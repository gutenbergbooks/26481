 /></span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">The</span> lectures, essays, and other matter
contained in these pages have been discovered
recently in a well-worn desk which
was formerly the property of a Lady Professor
of Girtham College; and as they
contain some original thoughts and investigations,
they have been considered
worthy of publication.</p>

<p>How they came into the possession of
the present writer it is not his intention to
disclose; but inasmuch as they seemed to
his unscientific mind to contain some important
discoveries which might be useful to
the world, he determined to investigate
thoroughly the contents of the mysterious
desk, and make the public acquainted with
its profound treasures. He found some
documents which did not refer exactly to
the subject of &lsquo;Polemical Mathematics;&rsquo;
but knowing the truth of the Hindoo
<a name="png.006" id="png.006"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">vi</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>proverb, &lsquo;The words of the wise are
precious, and never to be disregarded,&rsquo;
and feeling sure that this Lady Professor
of Girtham College was entitled to that
appellation, he ventured to include them
in this volume, and felt confident that in
so doing he would be carrying out the
intention of the Authoress, had she expressed
any wishes on the subject. In
fact, as he valued the interests of the State
and his own peace of mind, he dared not
withhold any particle of that which he
conceived would confer a lasting benefit
on mankind.</p>

<p>Internal evidence seems to show that
the earlier portion of the MS. was written
during the period when the authoress was
still <i>in statu pupillari</i>; but her learning
was soon recognised by the Collegiate
Authorities, and she was speedily elected
to a Professorship. Her lectures were
principally devoted to the abstruse subject
of Scientific Politics, and are worthy of the
attention of all those whose high duty it is
to regulate the affairs of the State.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">The Editor has been able to gather from
<a name="png.007" id="png.007"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">vii</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the varied contents of the desk some
details of the Author&#8217;s life, which increase
the interest which her words excite; and
he ventures to hope that the public will
appreciate the wisdom which created such
a profound impression upon those whose
high privilege it was to hear the lectures
for the first time in the Hall of Girtham
College.</p>

<h3>SOME REMARKS OF A GIRTHAM GIRL ON
FEMALE EDUCATION.</h3>


<p><small>[<i>This essay upon Female Education was evidently
written when the future Professor of Girtham
College was still in the lowlier condition of studentship,
before she attained that eminence for which
her talents so justly entitled her. Its unfinished
condition tends to show that it was probably
evolved during moments of relaxation from severer
studies, without any idea of subsequent publication.</i>]</small></p>

<p class="noindent above2"><span class="smc">Oh</span>, why should I be doomed to the
degradation of bearing such a foolish
appellation! A Girtham Girl! I suppose
we have to thank that fiend of invention
who is responsible for most of the titular
foibles and follies of mankind&mdash;artful Alliteration.
The two <em>G</em>&#8217;s, people imagine,
run so well together; and it is wonderful
that they do not append some other delectable
title, such as &lsquo;The Gushing Girl of
Girtham,&rsquo; or &lsquo;The Glaring Girl of Glittering
<a name="png.014" id="png.014"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">2</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Girtham.&rsquo; O Alliteration! Alliteration!
what crimes have been wrought in thy
name! Little dost thou think of the mischief
thou hast done, flooding the world
with meaningless titles and absurd phrases.
How canst thou talk of &lsquo;Lyrics of
Loneliness,&rsquo; &lsquo;Soliloquies of Song,&rsquo; &lsquo;Pearls
of the Peerage&rsquo;? Why dost thou stay
thine hand? We long for thee to enrich
the world with &lsquo;Dreams of a Dotard,&rsquo;
the &lsquo;Dog Doctor&#8217;s Daughters,&rsquo; and other
kindred works. Exercise thine art on these
works of transcendent merit, but cease to
style thy humble, but rebellious, servant a
Girtham Girl!</p>

<p>But what&#8217;s in a name? Let the world&#8217;s
tongue wag. I am a student, a hard-working,
book-devouring, never-wearied student,
who burns her midnight oil, and drinks the
strong bohea, to keep her awake during
the long hours of toil, like any Oxford or
Cambridge undergraduate. I often wonder
whether these mighty warriors in the lists&mdash;the
class lists, I mean&mdash;really work half
so hard as we poor unfortunate &lsquo;Girls of
Girtham.&rsquo; Now that I am writing in strict
<a name="png.015" id="png.015"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">3</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>confidence, so that not even the walls can
hear the scratchings of my pen, or understand
the meaning of all this scribbling, I
beg to state that I have my serious doubts
upon the subject; and when last I attended
a soirée of the Anthropological
Society, sounds issued forth from the
windows of the snug college rooms, which
could not be taken as evidences of profound
and undisturbed study.</p>

<p>Sometimes I glance at the examination
papers set for these hard-working students,
in order that they may attain the glorious
degree of B.A., and astonish their sisters,
cousins, and aunts by the display of these
magic letters and all-resplendent hood.
And again I say in strict confidence that
if this same glorious hood does not adorn
the back of each individual son of Alma
Mater, he ought to be ashamed of himself,
and not to fail to assume a certain
less dignified, but expressive, three-lettered
qualification. But before those Tripos
Papers I bow my head in humble adoration.
They sometimes take my breath
away even to read the terrible excruciating
<a name="png.016" id="png.016"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">4</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>things, which seem to turn one&#8217;s brain
round and round, and contort the muscles
of one&#8217;s face, and stop the pulsation of
one&#8217;s heart, when one tries to grasp the
horrid things.</p>

<p>Here is a fair example of the ingenuity
of the hard-hearted examiners, who resemble
the inquisitors presiding over the
tortures of the rack, and giving the hateful
machine just one turn more by way of
bestowing a parting benediction on their
miserable victims:</p>

<p>&lsquo;A uniform rod&rsquo; (it is a marvellous act
of mercy that the examiner invented it
<em>uniform</em>; it is strange that its thickness
did not vary in some complicated manner,
and become a veritable birch-rod!) &lsquo;of
length 2<i>c</i>, rests in stable equilibrium&rsquo;
(stable! another act of leniency!), &lsquo;with
its lower end at the vertex of a cycloid
whose plane is vertical&rsquo; (why not incline
it at an angle of 30°?) &lsquo;and vertex downwards,
and passes through a small, smooth,
fixed ring situated in the axis at a distance
<i>b</i> from the vertex. Show that if the equilibrium
be slightly disturbed, the rod will
<a name="png.017" id="png.017"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">5</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>perform small oscillations with its lower
end on the arc of the cycloid in the time</p>

<table class="math" summary="4[pi]sqrt(a{c^2+3(b-c)^2}/3g(b^2-4ac))">
<tr><td rowspan="2">4&pi;</td><td rowspan="2"><big class="enorm">&radic;</big></td>
<td class="dfrac"><i>a</i>{<i>c</i>&sup2; + 3(<i>b - c</i>)&sup2;}</td><td rowspan="2">,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="dfrac">3<i>g</i>(<i>b</i>&sup2; - 4<i>ac</i>)</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">where 2<i>a</i> is the length
of the axis of the cycloid.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A sweet pretty problem, truly! And
there are hundreds of the same kind&mdash;birch-rods
for every back! How the
examiner must have rejoiced when he
invented this diabolical rod, with its equilibrium,
its oscillations, its cycloid, and
other tormenting accessories. And yet, I
suppose, before my days of studentship
are over, I shall be called upon to attack
some such impregnable fortresses of mathematics,
when I hope to be declared equal
to some twentieth wrangler, if I escape
the misfortune of sharing a portion of the
&lsquo;wooden spoon.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Ah, you male sycophants! You would
prevent us from competing with you; you
would separate yourselves on your island
of knowledge, and sink the punt which
would bear us over to your privileged
shore. Of all the twaddle&mdash;forgive me,
male sycophants!&mdash;that the world has ever
<a name="png.018" id="png.018"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">6</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>heard, I think the greatest is that which
you have talked about female education.
And the best of it is, you are so anxious
about our welfare; you are so afraid that
we should injure our health by overmuch
mental exertion; you profess to think that
our brains are not calculated to stand the
strain of continued mental exercise; you
think that competition is not good for the
female mind; that we are too competitive
by nature&mdash;too ambitious! Yes, we are
so ambitious that we would enter the
lists with those who are asked in Public
Examinations to find the simple interest
on £1,000 for 5&nbsp;years at 6¼ per cent.;
so ambitious that we would compete with
those who are requested to disclose the
first aorist middle of <i title="Greek: tuptô">&tau;&upsilon;&pi;&tau;&omega;</i>. Oh, think of
the mental strain involved in such questions!
How it must ruin your health to
find out how many times a wheel of radius
6&nbsp;feet will turn round between York and
London, a distance of 200 miles! It is
quite wonderful how your brains, my dear
male sycophants, can stand such fearful demands
upon your intelligence and industry!</p>

<p><a name="png.019" id="png.019"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">7</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>But you are so kind to us, so afraid of
our health! Really, we are much obliged
to you. If you married one of us, or
became our guardian, or left us a legacy,
we should then recognise your interest in
us, and be very grateful to you for your
good advice. But as matters stand, we
are quite capable of taking care of ourselves.
We will promise not to work too
hard, if you will promise not to weary us
with your paternal jurisdiction.</p>

<p>But, male sycophants, I want a word
with you. Why do you object to our
taking degrees, or going in for examinations
in order to qualify ourselves for our
duties in life? You need not speak out
loud if you would rather not. Are you
not just a little afraid that we might eclipse
you? And it is not pleasant to be beaten
by a woman, is it? And then you profess
to think that we ought to be all housewives
and cooks, and knitters of stockings,
and sewers-on of our husbands&#8217; buttons;
but what if we have no husbands, no
buttons to sew? And is it not a little
selfish, my dear male sycophant, to wish
<a name="png.020" id="png.020"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">8</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to keep us all to yourself? to attend upon
the wants of the lords of creation, who
often distinguish themselves so much in
the domain of science?</p>

<p>Now, look me straight in the face (no
shirking, sir!). Is it not jealousy&mdash;green-eyed,
false-tongued jealousy&mdash;which saps
your generous instincts, and makes you
talk rubbish and nonsense about strains,
and brains, and ambition, and the like?
And if that is not hypocritical, I do not
know what is.</p>

<p>Well, good-day to you, male sycophant!
I really have not time to indulge myself in
scolding you any more. You are a good
creature, no doubt; and when you have
shown us what you can do, and can estimate
the capacity of the female brain, and
take a common-sense view of things, we
will recognise your privilege to speak;
and when I am the presiding genius of
Girtham College, I will grant you the use
of our hall for the purpose of lecturing to us
on &lsquo;Women&#8217;s Rights,&rsquo; or, as you may prefer
to entitle your discourse, &lsquo;Men&#8217;s Wrongs.&rsquo;</p>

 /></span>Oh, this is shameful! I really am very
sorry. Here have I been wasting a good
half-hour in dreaming, and slaying an
imaginary enemy with envenomed words
and frequent dabs of ink. If I cannot
concentrate my mind more on these
mathematical researches, I fear a dreadful
&lsquo;plough&rsquo; will harrow my feelings at the end
of my sojourn in these halls of learning.</p>

<p>Concentration! How many of our
words and ideas and thoughts are derived
from that primal fount of all arts and
sciences&mdash;mathematics! Here is one
which owes its origin to the mathematically
trained mind of some early philological
professor, who had learnt to apply
his scientific knowledge to the enrichment
of his native tongue. He quoted to
himself the words of the Roman poet:</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent6">&lsquo;Ego cur, acquirere pauca</div>
<div>Si possum, invideor, cum lingua Catonis et Ennî</div>
<div>Sermonem patrium ditaverit, et nova rerum</div>
<div>Nomina protulerit? Licuit, semperque licebit.&rsquo;</div>
</div>

<p>His mind conceived endless figures of
circles and ellipses scattered promiscuously
over the page, defying the attempts of the
<a name="png.022" id="png.022"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">10</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>student to reduce them to order. What
must he do before he can apply his
formulæ and equations, determine their
areas, or describe their eccentric motion?
He must reduce them to a common
centre, and then he can proceed to
calculate the abstruse problems in connection
with the figures described. They
may be the complex motions of double-star
orbits, or the results of the impact of
various projectiles on the tranquil surface
of a pool. It matters not&mdash;the principle
is the same; he must concentrate, and
reduce to a common centre.</p>

<p>This is the great defect of those who
have no accurate mathematical knowledge;
they cannot concentrate their minds with
the same degree of intensity upon the
work which lies before them. Their
thoughts fly off at a tangent, as mine do
very often; but then I have not been
classed yet in the Tripos; and, O male
poetical sycophant, you may be right after
all when you say:</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div>&lsquo;O woman! in our hours of ease</div>
<div>Uncertain, coy and hard to please,</div>
<div>As variable as the noon-day shade.&rsquo;</div>

<p class="noindent"><a name="png.023" id="png.023"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span

 /></span>Yes, as variable as the most variable
quantities <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>. I, a student of Girtham
College, blush to own that my thoughts
very often fly off at a tangent.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Fly off at a tangent!&rsquo; All hail to
thee, most noble mathematical phrase!
Here is another fine mathematical expression,
plainly exemplifying the action
of centrifugal force. The faster the
wheel turns, the greater is the velocity of
the discarded particles which fly off along
the line, perpendicular to the radius of
the circle. The world travels very fast
now; the increased velocity of the transit
of earthly bodies, the rate at which they
live, the multiplicity of engagements,
etc., have made the social world revolve
so fast that the speed would have startled
the torpid life of the last century. And
what is the result? Men&#8217;s thoughts fly off
at a tangent; they are unable to concentrate
their minds on any given subject;
they are content with hasty generalisms,
with short magazine articles on important
subjects, which really require large volumes
and patient study to elucidate them fully.</p>

attractive force, in order to prevent this
tangential motion&mdash;to increase the <em>force of

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; says the young lady who loves
to revel in the &lsquo;Ghastly Secret of the
Moated Dungeon,&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Mysteries of
Footlight Fancy,&rsquo; &lsquo;you are <em>grave</em> enough.
Pray don&#8217;t increase your gravity!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thank you, gentle critic. I will, in

the &lsquo;Mysteries of Footlight Fancy;&rsquo; seek
to know no more &lsquo;ghastly secrets,&rsquo; and

marvellously increased, by understanding
a little about Newton&#8217;s law of universal
gravitation, and don&#8217;t fly off at a tangent.</p>

 </span>The face is one of considerable beauty,
with eyes as clear, steadfast, and open as

lurking about the corners of the lips,
which do not seem altogether fitted for
pronouncing hard mathematical terms and
abstruse scientific problems. This photograph

<h3>LECTURE ON THE THEORY OF BRAIN WAVES
AND THE TRANSMIGRATION AND POTENTIALITY
OF MENTAL FORCES.</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">Professors and Students of the
University of Girtham, my Lords,
Ladies, and Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;I have the
honour to bring before you this evening
some original conceptions and discoveries
which have been formulated by me during
my researches in the boundless field of
mathematical knowledge; and though you
may be inclined at first to pronounce
them as somewhat hastily conceived hypotheses,
I hope to be able to demonstrate
the actual truth of the propositions which
I shall now endeavour to enunciate. It
is with some feelings of diffidence that I
stand before so august an assembly as the
present; and if I were not actually
<a name="png.028" id="png.028"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">16</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>convinced of the accuracy of my calculations,
I should never have presumed to appear
before you in the character of a lecturer.
But &lsquo;<i>Magna est veritas, et prævalebit</i>.&rsquo;
I cast aside maiden timidity; I
clothe myself in the professorial robe which
you have bestowed upon me, and sacrifice
my own feelings on the altar of Truth.</p>

<p>I have been engaged, as you are doubtless
aware, for some years in the pursuit
of mathematical research, exploring the
mines of science, which have of late been
worked very persistently, but often, like
the black diamond mines, at a loss. Concurrently
with these researches, I have
speculated on the great social problems
which perplex the minds of men, both
individually and collectively. And I have
come to the conclusion that the same
laws hold good in both spheres of work;
that methods of mathematical procedure
are applicable to the grand social problems
of the day and to the regulation
of the mutual relations which exist
between man and man. Take, for
example, the Force of public opinion. Of
<a name="png.029" id="png.029"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">17</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>what is it composed? It is the Resultant
of all the forces which act upon that
which is generally designated the &lsquo;Social
System.&rsquo; Public opinion is a compromise
between the many elements which make
up human society; and compromise is a
purely mechanical affair, based on the
principle of the Parallelogram of Forces.
Sometimes disturbing forces exert their
influence upon the action of Public
Opinion, causing the system to swerve
from its original course, and precipitating
society into a course of conduct inconsistent
with its former behaviour; and it
is the duty of the Governing Body to
eliminate as far as possible such disturbing
forces, in order that society may
pursue the even tenor of its way.</p>

<p>Professors, we have one great problem
to solve; and all questions social, political,
scientific, or otherwise, are only
fragments of that great problem. All
truths are but different aspects of different
applications of one and the same truth;
and although they may appear opposed,
they are not really so; and resemble
<a name="png.030" id="png.030"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">18</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>lines which run in various directions, but
lovingly meet in one centre.</p>

<p>Now, let us take for our consideration
the secret influence which men exert upon
each other, apart from that produced by
the power of speech (although that would
come under the same general law). As
mathematicians, you are aware that the
undulatory theory of light and heat and
sound are now accepted by scientific men
as the only sure basis of accurate calculation.
We know that the rays of light
travel in waves, and the equation representing
the waves is</p>

<table class="math" summary="y = a/r sin(2[pi]/[lambda]) (vt-r)">
<tr><td rowspan="2"><i>y</i> = </td><td><i>a</i></td><td rowspan="2"> sin </td>
<td>2&pi;</td><td rowspan="2"> (<i>vt - r</i>),</td></tr>
<tr><td class="dfrac"><i>r</i></td><td class="dfrac">&lambda;</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">where <i>y</i> is the disturbance of the ether,
<i>a</i> the initial amplitude, <i>r</i> the distance
from the starting-point, &lambda; the wave-length,
and <i>v</i> the velocity of light. Sound and
heat likewise have much the same form
of equation. Now, I maintain that the
waves of thought are governed by the
same laws, and can be determined by
an equation of the same form. You are
<a name="png.031" id="png.031"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">19</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>aware that in all these equations a certain
quantity denoted by &lambda; appears, and varies
for the different media through which the
sound, or light, or heat passes, and which
must be determined by experiment Now,
in my equation for brain waves, the same
quantity &lambda; appears which must be determined
by the same method&mdash;by <em>experiment</em>.
But how is this to be done? After
mature deliberation and much careful
thought, I have discovered the method for
finding &lambda;. This method is <em>mesmerism</em>.
We find the ratio of brain to brain&mdash;the
relative strength which one bears to
another; and then by an application of
our formula we can actually determine the
wave of thought, and read the minds of
our fellow-creatures. An unbounded field
for reflection and speculation is here suggested.
Like all great discoveries, the
elements of the problem have unconsciously
been utilized by many who are
unable to account for their method of
procedure. For example, thought-readers,
mesmerists, and the like, have unconsciously
been working on this principle,
<a name="png.032" id="png.032"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">20</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>although lack of mathematical training
has prevented them from fully mastering
the details of the problem. Hence in
popular minds a kind of mystery has
hung about the actions of such people,
and excited the curiosity of mankind.</p>

<p>The development of this theory of brain
waves may be of great practical utility to
the world. It shows that great care ought
to be exercised in the domain of thought,
as well as that of speech. For example:
A man has made a startling discovery,
from which he expects to receive considerable
worldly advantage. He would be
careful not to disclose his discovery in
speech to his acquaintances until his plans
are sufficiently matured, lest they should
impart it to the world, patent his device,
and reap the reward. But while he is
endeavouring to talk carelessly about it,
the wave of thought may be travelling
from brain to brain, suggesting the existence
of the discovery; and if the conditions
are favourable, and &lambda; sufficiently
small, it is possible that the idea itself
may be conveyed. Of course the more
<a name="png.033" id="png.033"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">21</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>complicated the discovery, the less likely
would the wave convey the conception.
Or suppose that one of the learned professorial
body of our sister university
should conceive an attachment for a lady-student
of Girtham College (of course a
very improbable supposition!), and the
infatuated <i>savant</i> became somewhat jealous
of another learned lecturer of the same
college (another improbability!), the fact
of his jealousy would be imparted to the
latter by a wave of thought, and might
cause considerable confusion in the serene
course of love or science. The fact of
the existence of the wave is indisputable.
What do all the stories of impressions and
double-sight teach us? How could the
intelligence of the death of Professor
Steele have been conveyed to his friend
and fellow-student, Professor Tait&mdash;the
one at Cambridge, the other at Edinburgh&mdash;were
it not for the existence of some
wave, which, like that of electricity, wings
its rapid flight unobserved by human eyes?
Are all the records of the Psychical Society
only myths and legends bred of
<a name="png.034" id="png.034"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">22</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>superstitious fancy? It were hard to suppose
so.</p>

<p>But if, gentlemen, and ladies especially,
you wish to keep your secret discoveries
to yourselves, watch over your thoughts as
well as your words; for my researches
prove, and the universal experience of
mankind corroborates the fact, that some
portion of your inmost thoughts and secret
desires are understood by your neighbours
(especially when &lambda; is small!); that they
travel along the waves which I have attempted
to indicate; and if you would
desire to extend your influence in the
world, probe the secret instincts of mankind,
and prevent yourself from being
deceived and wronged&mdash;study the art and
science of Brain Waves.</p>

<h3>LECTURE ON THE SOCIAL PROPERTIES OF
A CONIC SECTION, AND THE THEORY OF
POLEMICAL MATHEMATICS.</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">Most Learned Professors and Students
of this University</span>,&mdash;From the
interest manifested in my first lecture, I
conclude that my method of investigation
has not proved altogether unsatisfactory
to you, and I hope ere long to produce
certain investigations which will probably
startle you, and revolutionize the current
thought of the age. The application of
mathematics to the study of Social
Science and Political Government has
curiously enough escaped the attention of
those who ought to be most conversant
with these matters. I shall endeavour to
prove in the present lecture that the
relations between individuals and the
Government are similar to those which
<a name="png.038" id="png.038"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">26</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>mathematical knowledge would lead us
to postulate, and to explain on scientific
principles the various convulsions which
sometimes agitate the social and political
world.</p>

<p>Indeed, by this method we shall be able
to prophesy the future of states and
nations, having given certain functions and
peculiarities appertaining to them, just as
easily as we can foretell the exact day and
hour of an eclipse of the moon or sun. In
order to do this, we must first determine
the <em>social properties of a conic section</em>.</p>

<p>For the benefit of the unlearned and
ignorant, I will first state that a cone is
a solid figure described by the revolution
of a right-angled triangle about one of the
sides containing the right angle, which
remains fixed. The fixed side is called
the axis of the cone. Conic sections are
obtained by cutting the cone by planes.
It may easily be proved that if the angle
between the cutting plane and the axis be
equal to the angle between the axis and
the revolving side of the triangle which
generates the cone, the section described
<a name="png.039" id="png.039"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">27</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>on the surface of the cone is a parabola;
if the former angle be greater than the
latter, the curve will be an ellipse; and if
less, the section will be a hyperbola.</p>

<p>But the simplest conic section is, of
course, a circle, which is formed by a plane
at right angles to the axis of the cone;
and the simplest circle is that formed
by a plane passing through the apex of the
cone. All this is simple mathematics;
and let beginners consult more elementary
treatises than this one to satisfy themselves
on these points. But if they will
assume these things to be true, they will
know quite enough for our present
purpose. The simplest conic section
of all has been proved to be a <em>point</em>.
Now, this represents the simplest and
original form of society, a <em>single family</em>.
&lsquo;It is not good for man to be alone&rsquo;
was the first observation made by the
wise Creator upon the rational creature
whom He had introduced into
Paradise as its lord. Marriage is the
rudiment of all social life, from which
all others spring, out of which all others
<a name="png.040" id="png.040"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">28</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>are developed. Around the parents&#8217; knees
soon cluster a group of children, and in
their relation to each other we discern the
earliest forms of law and discipline&mdash;the
bonds by which society is held together.
When the children grow up, separate
households are formed; and then the
multiplication of families, the congregating
of men together for purposes of security
and mutual advantages in division of
labour; and thus is gradually formed a
state, which is only the development of
the family&mdash;the king representing the
parent, and ruling on the same principle.</p>

<p>Mathematically speaking, our plane no
longer passes through the apex. The
point represented the single family;
but keeping the plane horizontal, we
move it along the axis, the sections
will become <em>circles</em>, which represent
mathematically the next simplest form of
society, where the centre is the seat of
government, which is connected with each
individual member of the social circle by
equal radii. The social property of a
circle is that of a monarchical government
<a name="png.041" id="png.041"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">29</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>in its purest and simplest form. The
larger the circle becomes (<i>i.e.</i>, the further
you move the plane from the apex), the
greater the distance between the individual
and the monarch. Therefore, the more
independent the monarchy becomes, and
the less influence do individuals possess
over the ruling power. Hence, we may
infer that as years roll on, the government
will become more despotic; but the
stability of the country diminished, and
probably some individual particle, when
sufficiently withdrawn from the attraction
of the central head, will begin to revolve
on its own account, and spontaneously
generate a government of its own. We
may, therefore, conclude from mathematical
reasoning that an unlimited monarchy,
though advantageous for small states, is
not a safe form of government for a large
or populous country, inasmuch as the
people do not derive much benefit from
the sovereign; the mutual attraction,
which ought to exist in a flourishing state
between the ruler and the ruled, is
weakened; and the isolation of the
<a name="png.042" id="png.042"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">30</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>monarch tends to make him still more
despotic. As a practical example of the
truth of the foregoing statement, I may
mention the present condition of Russia,
which shows that the result of an unlimited
monarchy, in a large and unwieldy
social circle, is such as we should have
reasonably expected from mathematical
investigations.</p>

<p>Invariably, under the circumstances
which I have described, the country will
become disorganized; the sovereign will
cease to have any power over the people,
and the country will become a chaos,
without order, influence, or power.</p>

<p>When the centre of a conic section
moves along the axis of the curve to
infinity, banished by the mutual consent
of the individual particles which compose
the curve, or the nation, a figure is formed,
called a <em>parabola</em>. This is the curve
which the most erratic bodies in the
universe describe in space, as they rush
along at a speed inconceivable to human
minds, and are supposed to produce all
kinds of mischief and injury to the
<a name="png.043" id="png.043"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">31</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>worlds whose courses they wend their way
among.</p>

<p>This curve, then, represents the position
which the nation assumes when the constituted
monarchy, the centre of the system,
has been <em>banished to infinity</em>. A revolution
has occurred; the monarch has been
dethroned; and it is not hard to see that
the same erratic course which the comet
pursues in its flight, is observable with
respect to the social system which is
represented by a parabola. We observe
with eager scrutiny the wanderings of
these erratic comets. They appear suddenly
with their vapoury tails; sometimes
they shine upon us with their soft, silvery
light, brilliant as another moon; sometimes
they stand afar off in the distant
skies, and deign not to approach our
steady-going earth, which pursues its
regular course day by day, and year by
year. Then, after a few days&#8217; coy inspection
of our planet from different
points of view, they fly to other remote
parts of the universe, and do not condescend
to show themselves again for a
<a name="png.044" id="png.044"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">32</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>hundred years or so. Such is the erratic
conduct of a heavenly body whose course
is regulated by a parabolic curve.</p>

<p>We may look for similar eccentric behaviour
on the part of a community,
nation, or state, whose centre is at infinity,
whose constitution has been violently
disturbed, and whose monarchy is
situated in the far-off regions of unlimited
space. The erratic course of Republican
rule is proverbial. There is no stability,
no regularity. To-day we may observe its
brilliancy, which seems to laugh at and
eclipse the sombre shining of more
steady and enduring worlds; but ere to-morrow&#8217;s
moon has risen, it may have
vanished into the regions of eternal night,
and we look for its bright shining light in
the councils of the nations, but it has
ceased to shed its rays, and we are disappointed.
Sometimes it is asked, with
fear and trembling: &lsquo;What would be the
effect if our earth were to come in contact
with the tail of a comet? Should we be
destroyed by the collision, and our ponderous
world cease to be?&rsquo; But we are
<a name="png.045" id="png.045"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">33</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>assured that no such disastrous results
would follow. We have already passed
through the tails of many comets, but we
have not discovered any inconvenient
change in our ordinary mode of procedure.
It is probable that the comet&#8217;s
tail is composed of no solid substance.</p>

<p>We may therefore infer by analogy that
a Republican State would not offer any
powerful resistance if it were to come into
collision with a nation possessing a more
settled form of government. A shower of
meteoric stones, like passing fireworks,
might take place; but beyond that
nothing would occur to excite the fear,
or arouse the energies of the more
favoured nation. As an example of the
weakness of a Republican State I may
mention France. There we see an industrious
race of people, endowed with
many natural gifts and graces, a country
rich and productive; and yet, owing to
the unsettled nature of its government, all
these natural advantages are neutralized;
its course amongst the nations is erratic
in the extreme, a spectacle of feeble
<a name="png.046" id="png.046"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">34</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>administration; and it would offer no more
resistance to a colliding Power than the
empty vacuum of a comet&#8217;s tail. This
example will demonstrate to you the truth
of our theory with regard to the instability
of a social system which is geometrically
represented by a parabolic curve.</p>

<p>We will now turn from this picture of
insecurity and unrest to another figure
which possesses most advantageous social
properties. I refer to the ellipse. An
ellipse is a curve formed by the section
of a cone by a plane surface inclined at
an angle to the vertical axis of the cone,
greater than the angle between the axis
and the generating line.</p>

<p>Now, this is a curve which possesses
most attractive properties. It is the curve
which the earth and other planetary orbs
describe around the centre of the solar
system, as if nature intended that we
should take this figure as a guide in
choosing the most advantageous social
system. It possesses a centre, C, in view
of all the particles which compose the
curve, and connected with them by close
<a name="png.047" id="png.047"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">35</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>ties. It has two foci, S and S', fixed
points, by the aid of which we may trace
the curve.</p>

<p>In the interpretation of this figure, the
centre of the curve represents the throne
of monarchy. There is no tendency here
to revolutionize the State, to banish the
ruling power, and institute a Republican
form of government; but inasmuch as we
saw the weakness of an absolute monarchy
in large and populous States, as represented
by the circle, the wisdom of an
elliptical social system has ordained that
there shall be two foci, or houses of
representatives of the people, who shall
assist in regulating the progress of the
nation. Here we have a limited monarchy;
the throne is supported by the representatives
of the people; and the nearer these
foci of the nation are to the centre (<i>i.e.</i>,
in mathematical language, the less the
<em>eccentricity</em> of the curve), the more perfect
the system becomes&mdash;the greater the
happiness of the community.</p>

<p>In cases where the <em>eccentricity</em> becomes
very great, the beauty of the curve is
<a name="png.048" id="png.048"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">36</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>destroyed, and ultimately the ellipse is
merged into one straight line. Most
learned Professors, here we have a terrible
warning of the awful result of too much
eccentricity. Whether we regard the life
of the nation or of the individual, let all
bear in mind this alarming fact, that
eccentricity of thought, habit, or behaviour
may result, as in the case of this unfortunate
ellipse, which once presented such
fair and promising proportions to the
student&#8217;s admiring gaze, in the &lsquo;sinister
effacement of a man,&rsquo; or the gradual absorption
of a State into an uninteresting
thing &lsquo;which lies evenly between its extreme
points.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The great examples of Bacon, of Milton,
of Newton, of Locke, and of others,
happen to be directly opposed to the
popular inference that eccentricity and
thoughtlessness of conduct are the necessary
accompaniments of talent, and the
sure indications of genius. I am indebted
to Lacon for that reflection. You may
point to Byron, or Savage, or Rousseau,
and say, &lsquo;Were not these eccentric people
<a name="png.049" id="png.049"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">37</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>talented?&rsquo; &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; I answer; &lsquo;but
would they not have been better and
greater men if they had been less eccentric&mdash;if
they had restrained their caprice,
and controlled their <ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original lacks closing quote">passions?&rsquo;</ins> Do not
imagine, my young students of this university,
that by being eccentric you will
therefore become great men and women
of genius. The world will not give you
credit for being brilliant because you affect
the extravagances which sometimes accompany
genius. Some of you ladies, I
perceive, have adopted a peculiar form of
dress, half male, half female; or, to be
more correct, three-fourths male, and one-fourth
female. Do not imagine that you
will thus attain to the highest honours in
this university by your eccentricity, unless
your talents are hid beneath your short-cut
hair, and brains are working hard under
your college head-gear. As well might we
expect to find that all females who wear
sage-green and extravagant æsthetic costumes
are really born artists and future
Royal Academicians. It is apparent that
many aspirers to fame and talent are eager
<a name="png.050" id="png.050"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">38</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to exhibit their eccentricities to the gaze
of the world, in order that they may persuade
the multitude that they possess the
genius of which eccentricity is falsely supposed
to be the outward sign.</p>

<p>I may remark in passing that the eccentricity
of a parabolic curve is always <em>unity</em>.
What does this prove? You will remember
that a Republican State is represented by
a parabola. Therefore, however such a
nation may strive to alter its condition,
and secure a settled form of government,
its eccentricity will always remain the
same. It will always be erratic, peculiar,
unsettled; and this conclusion substantiates
our previous proposition with regard
to the condition of a social system represented
by a parabola.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">With regard to other advantages afforded
by an elliptical social system, we will defer
the consideration of this important
subject until my next lecture.</p>

<h3>THE SOCIAL PROPERTIES OF A CONIC
SECTION, AND THE THEORY OF POLEMICAL
MATHEMATICS&mdash;(<i>continued</i>).</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">Most learned Professors and Students
of this University</span>,&mdash;You have already
gathered from my preceding lecture my
method of procedure in the investigation
of the corresponding properties of curves
and States. You have perceived that we
have here the elements of a new science,
which may be extended indefinitely, and
applied to the various departments of self-government
and State control. This new
science of polemical mathematics is in
itself an extension of the <em>principle of continuity</em>,
for the discovery of which Poncelet
is so justly renowned. We can prove by
geometry that the properties of one figure
may be derived from those of another
<a name="png.052" id="png.052"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">40</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>which corresponds to it; and the new
science teaches us that if we can represent,
by projection or otherwise, a society of
particles or individuals on a plane surface,
the properties of the State so represented
are analogous to the properties of the
curve with which it corresponds. It is
only possible for me to touch upon the
elements of the science in these lectures,
but I hope to arouse an interest in these
somewhat unusual complications and
curious problems, that you may hereafter
make further discoveries in this unexplored
region of knowledge, and that the world
may reap the benefit of your labours and
abstruse studies. I have already, in my
previous lecture, touched upon the social
properties of the parabola, and examined
the constitution of erratic curves and
eccentric nations. It is my intention
to-day to speak of similar problems
which arise with reference to elliptical
States.</p>

<p>But, first, let me answer an objection
which may have occurred to your minds.
<a name="png.053" id="png.053"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">41</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Am I wrong in my calculations in attributing
too much to the power and usefulness
of forms of government? Does the
well-being and happiness of a nation depend
on the government, or upon the
individuals who compose the nation?
Most assuredly, I assert, they rest upon
the former. Men love their country when
the good of every particular man is comprehended
in the public prosperity; they
undertake hazard and labour for the
government when it is justly administered.
When the welfare of every citizen is the
care of the ruling power, men do not
spare their persons or their purses for the
sake of their country and the support of
their sovereign. But where selfish aims
are manifest in Court or Parliament, the
people care not for State officials who are
indifferent to their country&#8217;s weal; they
become selfish too; Liberty hides her head,
and shakes off the dust of her feet ere she
leaves that doomed land, and the stability,
welfare, and prosperity of that country
cease.</p>

<p><a name="png.054" id="png.054"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">42</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>I might refer you to many a stained
page of national history in order to prove
this. Compare the closing chapters of the
life of the Roman empire with the record
of the brave deeds of its ancient warriors
and valorous statesmen. Grecian preeminence
and virtue died when liberty
expired. I agree with Sidney when he
writes that it is absurd to impute this to
the change of times; for time changes
nothing, and nothing was changed in
those times but the government, and that
changed all things. These are his words:
&lsquo;As a man begets a man, and a beast a
beast, that society of men which constitutes
a government upon the foundation
of justice, virtue, and the common good,
will always have men to promote those
ends; and that which intends the advancement
of one man&#8217;s desires and
vanity will abound in those that will
foment them.&rsquo; I may not, therefore, be
altogether wrong in attributing the prosperity
and well-being of a nation to the
form of government which it possesses.</p>

<p><a name="png.055" id="png.055"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">43</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>We will now proceed to the consideration
of the social advantages which an
elliptical State affords. This is the form
of government and social position which
we, as a nation, at present enjoy; and
from mathematical considerations I am
of opinion that it is the best, and hope
that no change will ever be made in our
constitution. You may remember that I
have previously stated that an ellipse has
a centre and two foci, in view of all the
particles which compose the curve, and
connected with them by close ties. The
centre, in the projected figure, represents
the monarchy, which is limited; and the
government is carried on by the aid of
the two houses of representatives of the
people, depicted in the projection by the
two foci.</p>

<p>Now the social advantages of the ellipse
are given by the fact that the sum of the
distances of any point from the foci is
always constant. No particle is left out
in the cold; no one does not possess
the advantages of a social government.
<a name="png.056" id="png.056"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">44</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Though his distance may be far from the
Upper House, he has the advantage of
nearness to the Lower, and <i>vice versâ</i>. The
sum of the distances is constant. The
extinction of one focus, the House of
Lords, for example, would create a complete
disorganization of the whole system:
the other focus would set up a powerful
magnetic attraction, and a curious bulb-shaped
curve would be evolved, very
different from the beautiful symmetrical
form which the original figure presented
to the eye. The centre of the system
would be disturbed; and it is probable
that ere long it would disappear along the
axis and be vanished to infinity. Thus
the curve would become a parabola. This
is the alarming result of the extinction of
one focus. Abolish the House of Lords,
and you will soon find that the Throne
will be disturbed; the State will become
disorganized; the nation will become
confused by the magnetic force of the
Lower House, uncounteracted by any other
attraction; and very soon a complete
<a name="png.057" id="png.057"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">45</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>revolution of the whole system will set
in: the monarch will be dethroned, and
a Republican form of government, with all
the eccentricities of a parabolic course,
will take the place of a more orderly and
settled constitution. This is a plain
deduction from our mathematical investigations;
and it behoves all our statesmen,
our philosophers and great men, our
fellow-citizens and the humblest artisans
in our manufacturing towns, to weigh well
this alarming result of the abolition of
that House which has been threatened
with destruction; and to ascertain for
themselves the truths upon which my proposition
and reasoning rest.</p>

<p>I have already observed that the fact
that the earth&#8217;s orbit and that of other
planets are in the form of ellipses; that
the curvature of the earth is nearly the
same, ought to guide us in choosing this
particular curve as a model of the projection
of a complete and most advantageous
social system.</p>

<p>The circle described on the major axis of
<a name="png.058" id="png.058"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">46</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>an ellipse, is called the <em>auxiliary circle</em>, and
affords much assistance in the investigation
of the properties of an ellipse. As
we have already shown, the circle represents
the simplest form of monarchical
government. Hence, if we compare the
form of government represented by an
ellipse (<i>i.e.</i>, such as we now enjoy) with
that of a system where the king is the only
governing power, we may obtain great
assistance in solving complicated political
problems.</p>

<p>In all conics there is a straight line
called the &lsquo;directrix,&rsquo; which represents in
social or polemical science the laws of the
nation, and plays a prominent part in the
mutual relations of the individual particles.
For instance, in the case of the parabola,
the distance of any particle from the
directrix is equal to its distance from the
focus.</p>

<p>From this we may conclude that if an
individual deviates at all from the path
which the laws (or, directrix) indicate, if
he does not show true respect to the
<a name="png.059" id="png.059"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">47</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>decrees of the focal government, and
preserve the true position between them,
directly he is found deviating from his
course, he is quickly banished to a less
enlightened sphere. In an ellipse there
is less likelihood of his straying away from
the course which the directrix points out,
on account of the two-fold guidance which
he receives from the two foci.</p>

<p>The following curious problem may be
noticed. If a parabola roll on another
parabola, their <ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'virtices'">vertices</ins> coinciding, the
focus of the first traces out the directrix
of the second.</p>

<p>Here we come to the consideration of
the international relationship of States.
Two nations have the same form of
government (in this example this form is
Republican); their policies coincide: we
may conclude from this proposition that
the course which the government of one
nation will pursue, will be that which is
prescribed by the laws of the other.</p>

<p>The subject of the contact of curves
presents many interesting problems with
<a name="png.060" id="png.060"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">48</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>reference to Polemical Science, and may
be extended indefinitely. It is well known
that there are different orders of contact,
which are designated as the <em>first</em>, <em>second</em>,
or <em>third</em> order. This last order may be
termed the &lsquo;marriage of curves,&rsquo; cemented
by the osculating circle, or &lsquo;wedding-ring;&rsquo;
and when two nations have contact
of the third order, they have formed a
very close alliance, and by calculation we
can obtain the <em>radius of curvature</em>, or size
of the wedding-ring, by means of which
they may be united.</p>

<p>The theory and nature of contact constitute
a branch of our newly discovered
science which we commend to the careful
consideration of those who have undertaken
the difficult and perplexing study of
international law. Alas! too many States
refuse this friendly contact, and, consequently,
<em>cut</em> each other, instead of
blending in sweet accord. Their peace is
at best an armed neutrality; and if they
have contact of only the <em>first</em> or <em>second</em>
order, we can prove mathematically that
<a name="png.061" id="png.061"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">49</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>they are sure to intersect in some other
point or points; and divergence of policy
and disturbed relations are the results.
Contact of the <em>third, or highest, order</em> is
the only safe position for two allied, or
contiguous, States.</p>

<p>With your permission I will add a few
words to those I have already uttered
with regard to the directrix. As necessary
as the directrix is to the curve, so are
the corresponding laws to the State. I
will prove this fact by a few examples.
English people have laws, and know how
to obey them; therefore their numbers
increase; they thrive and are prosperous.
A friendly critic of another nation has
said that the reason why Englishmen
rule the world, is because they know how
to obey. On the other hand, the gipsies
have no laws; hence they become fewer
and less powerful. What is the condition
of all tribes and nations which are not
governed by laws? They invariably
remain poor and miserable. They are in
want of a directrix; and if we could
<a name="png.062" id="png.062"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">50</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>supplement the gift with foci and centre, they
would soon emerge from their savage condition,
and become more civilized.</p>

<p>I have omitted to mention the hyperbolic
form of government. The curve
formed by the intersection of the surface
of a cone with a plane will be a hyperbola,
when the inclination of the cutting
plane to the axis of the cone is less than
the constant angle which the generating
line forms with the axis. It is manifest
that the plane will thus intersect the
higher cone, and produce the figure
which is known to mathematicians as
the hyperbola.</p>

<p>We may hence deduce the following
property of the corresponding hyperbolic
State. We take cognizance of that higher
cone with which the mundane affairs of
the lower cone are closely connected. As
an example of this system we may mention
the vast temporal rule and power of the
Papal Throne, which formerly exercised
such marvellous sway over the nations of
Europe.  By an appeal to a Higher
<a name="png.063" id="png.063"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">51</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Authority than that of earthly kings and
potentates was this rule exercised; but its
hyperbolic form is fast passing away, and
degenerating into that of a circle with
indefinitely small radius. We shall not,
therefore, discuss the complex polemical
problems which a hyperbolic State
suggests.</p>

<p>I will now mention a few problems
which are easily capable of proof, and
deduce from them the necessary conclusions
which must follow when we apply
our newly discovered principles of polemical
science.</p>

<p>1. &lsquo;If from any point in a straight line
a pair of tangents be drawn to an ellipse,
the chords of contact will pass through a
fixed point.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I will not trouble you with the proof of
this proposition, as it is evident to all
mathematicians, and can easily be demonstrated.
But mark well the deductions,
when we interpret this mathematical language
in correct polemical terms. A State,
through various convulsions of its own,
<a name="png.064" id="png.064"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">52</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>has merged into a condition represented
by a straight line, having lost its symmetry,
its beauty, its curvilinear proportion.
An individual unhappily situated
in this unfortunate community regards
with longing eyes the prosperous condition
of those who enjoy the social advantages
of a settled form of government, and other
blessings which accompany elliptical jurisdiction
and laws. [Two tangents are
drawn to an ellipse.] No matter where
the individual may be in the unhappy
envious straight line, the result of his reflection
will be the same. Sympathetic
chords are drawn, joining the points of
contact of the tangents with the curve;
they all pass through a fixed point. All
these conclusions of the various individuals
on the straight line will be the same. All
are of opinion that the elliptical form is
the best; and they mourn in secret over
the sad events which have occurred in
their own national life, their eccentricity,
their lawlessness, when they see the
advantages which their more staid and
sober-minded neighbours so freely enjoy.</p>

<p><a name="png.065" id="png.065"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">53</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>2. The normal at any point of an ellipse
bisects the angle between the focal distances
of that point.</p>

<p>The normal is the perpendicular from
the point on the major axis; it is the line
of thought directed by the observance of
just laws and rules. Hence this proposition
shows that the individual citizen,
when guided by sound judgment, regards
with equal favour and entire approval the
existence of both foci, or Houses of Legislature.
He considers that both are necessary
to his comfort, and the right regulation
of the State&#8217;s welfare. He cares not for
the <em>abnormal</em> condition of those who talk
as if the existence of either House were
unnecessary to his country&#8217;s weal, and
bestows a pitying glance on those wandering
lights, or disturbed erratic governments,
which do not possess the advantages
which from experience he has learned to
love and to respect. No matter what his
condition may be, the same opinions are
held by all classes, all ranks and degrees;
and if a <ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'self-opiniated'">self-opinionated</ins> particle think otherwise,
he ought to be transferred to a less
<a name="png.066" id="png.066"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">54</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>enlightened sphere, and migrate to a parabolic
state, or uninteresting straight line.
And when he has changed his location,
he will look back on his old home and
old surroundings with longing eyes and an
aching heart, thinking of the blessings he
has lost by his own rash act. This can
be proved mathematically. He looks for
an ideal state of society, leaps after the
shadow his fancy has depicted; and when
he finds himself outside his former state,
he looks back with longing eyes at the
once-scorned focus. What is the focus of
a perpendicular on the tangent of an
ellipse from any external point? Can it
not be proved to be a <em>circle</em>? That is to
say, he will be more conservative than
ever. He would like to return to a primitive
form of government. Farewell to his
wild schemes and revolutionary measures!
Farewell to his disestablishments, abolitions,
and suppressions! The throne and
government have new attractions in his
eyes; loyalty, a new feeling, asserts its
benign influence; and if he could return
<a name="png.067" id="png.067"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">55</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to his former position, his normal conduct
would be straighter than ever, for
by sad experience he has learned the
value of those things which he once
despised.</p>

<p>But we need not depend upon one
proof alone. Exactly the same result may
be obtained from the well-known proposition
which states that &lsquo;the angle between
the tangent from any external point and
the focal distance is equal to the angle
between the other tangent and the focal
distance.&rsquo;</p>

<p>3. The same opinions are often held
by individuals in quite different walks and
classes of life. Let these individuals be
represented by points on an ellipse. Join
these, and we have a system of parallel
chords. Draw a straight line through the
middle points of these chords, and lo! it
will always pass through the centre. This
shows that the central thought of all people
is directed to the sovereign&mdash;that <em>loyalty</em>
is inherent in the hearts of those who
recognise elliptical laws.</p>

<p><a name="png.068" id="png.068"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">56</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>I will conclude this lecture with a few
remarks on the nature and properties of
the <em>radical axis</em>. This name was first
given, I believe, by M.&nbsp;Gaultier, of Tours,
and for a full account of its nature I refer
you to the <cite>Journal de l&#8217;École Polytechnique</cite>,
xvi., 1813. The radical axis of two circles
is the line perpendicular to the line joining
the centres, from any point of which
the tangents to the circles are equal. Let
us suppose that one circle becomes a point,
and that this point is situated on the circumference
of the first circle. What is
the result? The radical axis becomes
the tangent to the circle. Hence we
may conclude that in a social system of
monarchical government the radical axis
is perpendicular to the line attaching the
individual with the monarch. Therefore
we may conclude that the radical axis
indicates a tendency of particles, or individuals,
to fly off at a tangent, at right
angles to the connecting-link between the
individual and the king. When any motion
takes place, this is evident, and this
<a name="png.069" id="png.069"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">57</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>tendency is called centrifugal force. Sad is
it for the State when this force is called
into play, and the radical axis is a standing
menace to the stability of States and
nations. The only way to counteract its
baneful, disturbing influence is to increase
the attraction of the monarch on the individual,
which nullifies the former force,
and prevents further mischief. This is the
method which nature itself adopts in the
motions of the planetary worlds; the attraction
of the sun prevents any disturbance
which might be caused in the course
of the planets by the action of centrifugal
force, and nature suggests this plan for
our adoption. Increase the attraction of
the Throne; rigidly connect each individual
by the strong chords of affection, advantage
and utility with the ruling power;
and then, though the radical axis may be
there, it will cease to indicate any motion
along it, it will not prevail over the counteracting
influence of loyalty, and the stability
of the social system and the happiness of
the individuals will be the results.</p>

<div>Serve him with all my fortune here at home,</div>
<div>And serve him with my person in the wars;</div>
<div>Watch for him, fight for him, bleed for him, die for him,</div>
<div>As every true-born subject ought.&rsquo;</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This, most noble professors, is the language
of true patriotic loyalty. Let the
monarch be loved and loving, let the
laws be just and equal, happy will be the
people, prosperous the realm. There are
those who counsel different things, and
preach sedition and the breaking-up of
laws; but those who advocate such doctrines
lack that judicial mathematical
training which we, students and professors
of Girtham College, have acquired. If
polemical mathematics, the science of the
future, should become more widely studied;
if its results were disseminated far and
wide; above all, if the proper position
which women ought to occupy in the
counsels of the nation were assigned to
them, we should hear less of these wild
schemes and foolish theories, and the influence
of women would tend greatly to
<a name="png.071" id="png.071"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">59</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>promote the stability and security of the
State.</p>

<p>Why, let me ask, should woman be
excluded from that position which is so
justly hers? from those duties which she
can discharge so faithfully? It has been
said that if we wish to know the political
and moral condition of a State, we must
ask what rank women hold in it. We are
told that women have more strength in
their looks than men have in their laws.
Why, then, do men debar her from those
fields of occupation wherein she may
labour for the nation&#8217;s good, and use her
influence, which they acknowledge to be
great, in those callings wherein she may
most easily benefit the State, and the
country she so ardently loves?</p>

<p>At some future time I hope to speak
more fully on this subject; and in concluding
this lecture, I will remark that
English politics need a leavening influence
which will counteract the evil tendencies
and corrupt theories which, in spite of our
advantageous social system, at present
<a name="png.072" id="png.072"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">60</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>exist; and this leavening influence will be
best produced by the admission of those
into the counsels of the nation who are
acknowledged to have a benign and healthy
influence&mdash;the women of England. Let
women have their proper share in the
government of the country, and I have
no fear lest we shall preserve our elliptical
constitution, and all the advantages which
we at present enjoy.</p>

<p>[<span class="smc">Editorial Note.</span>]&mdash;In the bundle of
papers which contained the foregoing
lectures, some letters of great interest
were found, which show that the fame
of the learned Lady Professor of Girtham
College had already gone abroad, and
attracted the attention of the leading
statesmen of the day. It is to be regretted
that the answers to these letters
are not forthcoming, as it might be proved
from them that the science of polemical
mathematics has already influenced the
minds of our legislators in their conduct
<a name="png.073" id="png.073"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">61</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of affairs at home and abroad. The
following letter is of unique interest, and
may be taken as evidence of the favourable
impression which this new science
has made on the mind of one of our
greatest thinkers and statesmen:</p>

<p class="address"><small>Downing Street,</small></p>
<p class="date"><small>May, 18&mdash;</small></p>

<p><span class="smc">My dear Lady Professor</span>,&mdash;The
report of the amazing results of your
scientific researches has reached me, and
I congratulate you most heartily on the
originality and acumen which you have
displayed in your investigations. A new
light has dawned upon our country.
Instead of groping in the darkness of
political warfare, ensnared by party ties
and jealousies, the statesmen of the future
will be able to calculate and determine the
correct course with mathematical precision
and perfect accuracy. No one can
dispute the truth of a proposition in
Euclid, or the genuineness of Newton&#8217;s
laws; and if your method enables men to
<a name="png.074" id="png.074"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">62</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>calculate and determine the correct political
course of action, to solve political
problems as easily as exponential equations,
why&mdash;then adieu to the bickerings
of party, the querulous complaints of the
Opposition! Nay, joy to the Ministry!
There will be no Opposition! Our statesmen
will be able to guide the great ship of
the State by means of charts which know
no error; and they will resemble an
association of savants met together to
determine the exact moment of the
transit of Venus, or to examine the degree
of density of a comet&#8217;s tail.</p>

<p>This condition of Parliamentary procedure
is much to be desired; you have
shown how such an ideal state of things
may be obtained. In the name of the
Government I thank you for your endeavours
on behalf of your country&#8217;s
welfare, and look forward to a further
development of your admirably conceived
system. As in the domain of ordinary
science there are complex questions
which defy the acumen of the philosopher;
<a name="png.075" id="png.075"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">63</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>so in polemical science there may be
questions which present the same difficulties
and complications. But as the first
are daily yielding before the persevering
attacks of the mathematician, so I doubt
not polemical science will soon overcome
the various problems which may
arise.</p>

<p>But it is mainly on my own account
that I venture to address you. I desire
to consult you with regard to certain
matters&mdash;political complications&mdash;which
have recently occupied the attention of
Her Majesty&#8217;s Ministers. By the help of
your new science, can you aid us in our
deliberations? Of course, I am writing
to you in <em>strict confidence</em>, and beg that you
will keep this communication profoundly
secret. I fear that would be a hard task
for many of your sex, who do not possess
your knowledge and powers of mind;
but I have great confidence in your discretion.</p>

<p>These are the problems which are
presented to us for solution:</p>

<p><a name="png.076" id="png.076"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">64</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>1. Some members of the Cabinet are
secretly in favour of Protection, and the
country is rather stirred by the question.
Can you, from your knowledge of the
contact of curves and nations, help us to
determine what course we ought to take
with regard to Spain, for example? Are
the principles of Adam Smith mathematically
correct?</p>

<p>2. I observe that England is represented
mathematically by an ellipse.  Are we
right in assuming that Ireland is a portion
of that ellipse? Or, on the other hand,
in our chart of nations, must we describe
that troublesome country as a rotating
parabola, or complex figure, altogether outside
our more favoured State?</p>

<p>3. Do you consider, from your minute
observation of our social system, that the
form of our elliptical government is
gradually undergoing a change, and that
a revolutionary parabolic tendency is
observable in the action of individual
particles?</p>

<p>4. Is it not possible that the differences
<a name="png.077" id="png.077"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">65</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>in the policy of the various nations of
Europe; the difficulties which beset the
carrying out of international law; the
jealousies, quarrels, and rivalries of
States might disappear, if the same form
of government (<i>i.e.</i>, elliptical) were adopted
in each?</p>

<p>If you will kindly favour Her Majesty&#8217;s
Ministers with your opinion on these
questions, they will owe you a debt of
gratitude, which they, as representatives of
the nation, will do their utmost to repay.</p>

<p>With every good wish for your further
success in the regions of polemical science,</p>

<p class="sig1">I beg to remain,</p>
<p class="sig2">My dear Lady Professor,</p>

 </span>impossible to please everyone, even if that
happy consummation were desirable. This
letter was evidently called forth by some
remarks which the learned Lady Professor
had made in her third lecture with reference
to eccentricity in dress. Our
readers will recollect that the professor
pointed out that an extravagant &lsquo;bloomer&rsquo;
costume&mdash;half male, half female&mdash;was no
more a sign of genius than æsthetic
dresses, always betokened the artist.<sup><a href="#fn.5" name="fna.5" id="fna.5">5</a></sup>
This latter statement evidently gave great
offence to the members of a society
which called itself the &lsquo;Æsthetic and
Dress Improvement Association,&rsquo; and
the following letter is the result of one of
their solemn conclaves:</p>

<p class="address"><small>Oscar Villa, South Kensington,</small></p>
<p class="date"><small>June, 18&mdash;.</small></p>

<p>The Secretary of the Æsthetic and
Dress Improvement Association presents
his compliments to the Lady Professor of
Girtham College, and begs to contradict
emphatically her statements with regard
<a name="png.079" id="png.079"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">67</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to a subject upon which she is evidently
in entire and lamentable ignorance, and
to protest against her aspersions upon
the artistic studies of this and kindred
societies. He begs to state that true
æsthetes are <em>not</em> eccentric (they leave that
to lady professors and her Philistine followers);
that to dress becomingly is one
of the principal objects of life, and that
true greatness is achieved as much by the
study of the art of dress as by any other
noble pursuit or graceful accomplishment.
Are not Horatio Postlethwaite, Leonara
Saffronia Gillan, Vandyke Smithson entitled
to greatness? And yet their laurels
have been won solely by the art of dress.
Perhaps the lady professor has never read
&lsquo;Sartor Resartus&rsquo;! In conclusion, he
would ask the Lady Professor to refrain
from casting obloquy upon the work of
the Association which he has the honour
to represent; to prevail upon her pupils
to abandon the unfeminine attire which
some of them have assumed, contrary to
the first principles of art; to array themselves
in flowing robes of sage-green and
<a name="png.080" id="png.080"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span

<p class="smc">My dear Tutor,</p>

<p>You will be glad to hear that after
superhuman exertions I have at last succeeded
in passing my Little-go, and I am
eternally grateful to you for all you have
done for me. I should never have got
through if it had not been for you. All
the coaches in Cambridge would never
have managed it, but you drove me
through in a canter. And why? I never
could make up my mind to work for them;
<a name="png.081" id="png.081"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">69</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>but when I coached with you, you made
me like it. I almost revelled in the
Binomial when you wrote it out for me;
and then I could not help listening to
you; and you looked so grieved when I
would not learn, and made me feel such
a brute; so somehow or other you drove
some mathematics into my head, and I
pulled through. By-the-bye, I think you
must have tried the &lsquo;brain wave&rsquo; dodge
with the examiners, as five out of the six
propositions in Euclid, which you told me
to get up specially, were set! I wish I
could read people&#8217;s thoughts; can you read
mine? If I were a Don, or a Fellow, or
something, I would advise the University
to have some lady professors like you to
teach the men, instead of some of these
sleepy old tutors. It would be a great
improvement, and I am sure we should
get through a great deal more work.</p>

<p>They have given me a place in the Jesus
Eight, which I shall take now that I am
released from your professorial ban, and
have time for rowing. But I don&#8217;t half
like giving up mathematics. You see, I
<a name="png.082" id="png.082"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">70</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>have grown fond of the study. Do you
think you could make a wrangler of me?
At any rate, I should like to come to your
lectures again. May I?</p>

<h3>A LECTURE UPON SOCIAL FORCES, WITH
SOME ACCOUNT OF POLEMICAL KINEMATICS.</h3>


<p><span class="smc">Most noble Professors and Students
of Girtham College</span>,&mdash;Since last &lsquo;I
wandered &#8217;twixt the pole and heavenly
hinges, &#8217;mongst encentricals, centres, concentricks,
circles, and epicycles,&rsquo; like the
great Albumazar, and found them full of
life and wisdom for the guidance of our
States and laws, I have turned my attention
to the Applied Mathematics, in order
to determine what other truths this shaft
may yield.</p>

<p>The strength of all sciences, according
to Bacon, consists in their harmony; and
it is truly marvellous how perfect this
harmony is, if our ears are tuned aright to
hear it.  We have observed how the
<a name="png.084" id="png.084"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">72</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>beautiful and regular laws of curves and
cones correspond to the social laws of
States and nations, guiding them as if by
word of counsel, admonishing them on
what principle they ought to regulate
their governments and inter-relations. We
have seen that the laws which govern
thought and light and sound are almost
identical, and that harmony pervades not
merely the ordinary sciences, but extends
her benign influence over these newly
discovered fields of scientific research,
which I claim to have discovered.</p>

<p>All this may appear at first sight surprising;
but the real philosopher, who
knows that all kinds of truth are intimately
connected, will receive such revelations
of science with satisfaction rather
than astonishment; for this new science,
which has opened itself out before me, is
only an extension of other well-known
laws and discoveries which have come
down to us from the remote past.</p>

<p>If my investigations should appear to
you, most noble professors, somewhat novel
and imaginary, remember the maxim of
<a name="png.085" id="png.085"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">73</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the sage, that in the infancy of science
there is no speculation which does not
merit careful examination; and the most
remote and fanciful explanations of facts
have often been found the true ones.
Perhaps some &lsquo;self-opinionated particle&rsquo;
(I speak mathematically) may have been
inclined to laugh at our theories and discoveries,
as the wise fools of the day
laughed at Kepler and his laws; but time
has changed the world&#8217;s laughter into
praise, and a century hence our discoveries
may rank among the achievements of
modern science. As Cicero says, &lsquo;Time
obliterates the fictions of opinions, but
confirms the decisions of nature.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I have not shunned, most noble professors,
to enlist Imagination under the
banner of Geometry; for I am fully persuaded
that it is a powerful organ of
knowledge, and is as much needed by the
mathematician as by the poet or novelist.
It is, I fear, often banished with too much
haste from the fields of intellectual research
by those who take upon themselves
to give laws to philosophy. We need
<a name="png.086" id="png.086"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">74</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>imagination to form an hypothesis; and
without hypotheses science would soon
become a lifeless and barren study, a
horse-in-the-mill affair ever strolling round
and round, unconscious of the grinding
corn. In my previous investigations my
imagination pictured the symmetry of
curves and States; the hypothesis followed
that the laws which regulated them were
identical, and you have observed how the
supposition was confirmed by our subsequent
calculations.</p>

<p>In this lecture I propose to examine
some of the forces which exist in our
social system, and shall endeavour to
estimate them by methods of mathematical
procedure and analogical reasoning.
We will begin with the old definition
of Force as <em>that which puts matter into
motion, or which stops, or changes, a
motion once commenced</em>. When a mass
is in motion, it has a capacity for doing
work, which is called <em>Energy</em>; and when
this energy is caused by the motion of a
body it is called Kinetic Energy (in
mathematical language <span class="nw">KE = ½ MV&sup2;</span>).
<a name="png.087" id="png.087"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">75</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Another form of kinetic energy is called
Potential Energy, which is in reality the
capacity of a body for doing work <em>owing
to its position</em>. For example we may take
an ordinary eight-day clock. When the
weights are wound up, they have a certain
amount of potential energy stored up,
which will counteract the friction of the
wheels and the resistance of the air on
the pendulum. Or, again, we have the
example of a water-wheel: first the water
in the reservoir, being higher than the
wheel, has an amount of potential energy.
This is converted into kinetic energy in
striking against the paddles, and after this
we have potential energy again produced
by the action of the fly-wheel.</p>

<p>By the principle of conservation of
energy, if we consider the whole universe,
not our planet alone (for its heat and
energy are continually diminished to some
slight degree), we find that <em>no energy is lost</em>.</p>

<p>Force is recognised as acting in two
ways: in <em>Statics</em>, so as to compel rest, or
to prevent change of motion; and in
<em>Kinetics</em>, so as to produce or to change
<a name="png.088" id="png.088"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">76</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>motion; and the whole science which investigates
the action of force is called
<em>Dynamics</em>.</p>

<p>All this is of course pure mathematics,
and I have made these elementary observations
for the benefit of my younger
hearers, the students of this University.
My grave and reverend seniors will pardon,
I am sure, the repetition of facts well
known to them for the sake of those who
are less informed than themselves.</p>

<p>Now before I proceed further, I will
endeavour to point out that these elementary
truths of physical science hold good
in our social system. Each individual is
a mass, acted on by numerous forces,
capable of &lsquo;doing work,&rsquo; which work can
be measured and his velocity calculated.
Some individuals have a vast <em>potential
energy</em>; that is to say, from their position
and station in the social system, they have
a power which is capable of producing
work which a less exalted individual has
not. Like the weights in an eight-day
clock, or the water in a reservoir, they
have a capacity for doing work, owing to
<a name="png.089" id="png.089"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">77</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the position to which they have been
raised. How vast the influence of a
Primate or a Premier, a General or a
King! And yet their power is chiefly
potential energy, arising from the position
they occupy, not from the individuals
themselves. Schiller has described this in
poetical language, which, strange to say, is
mathematically correct:</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div>&lsquo;Yes, there&#8217;s a patent of nobility</div>
<div class="indent">Above the meanness of our common state;</div>
<div>With what they <em>do</em> the vulgar natures buy</div>
<div class="indent">Their titles; and with what they <em>are</em>, the <em>great</em>.&rsquo;</div>
</div>

<p>Other forces may have raised these men
to their exalted positions; but their influence
is due to their height, their potential
energy. Placed on a lower level, they
would cease to have that power. How
calm the dignity of this potential rank!
The water in the reservoir is scarcely
ruffled or disturbed, as if unconscious of
its power; when it has lost its force it
rushes along with a sullen murmur and a
roar, howling and hissing and boiling in
endless torture, until&mdash;</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div>&lsquo;It gains a safer bed, and steals at last</div>
<div>Along the mazes of the quiet vale.&rsquo;</div>
</div>

<p><a name="png.090" id="png.090"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">78</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>So the vulgar crowd rushes on, with
plenty of kinetic force, making noise
enough and looking very busy; while
those who seem to sleep in calm forgetfulness,
exercise their potential energy, and
do the real work of turning the great
engine of the State.</p>

<p>There are attractive and repulsive forces
(more commonly the latter, the cynic will
say) in our social system, but each individual
is the centre of various forces acting
upon him. In nature all matter possesses
the force of gravity, and whatever the
size of two particles may be, they mutually
attract each other. The earth attracts the
moon; the moon attracts the earth. A
stone thrown up into the air exercises an
infinitesimal force upon the earth; so in
the social system every individual, however
small and insignificant he may be,
exercises some attractive force upon his
neighbour. There is no one in the world
who does not exercise some influence for
good or for evil upon his fellows.</p>

<p>The force of <em>cohesion</em> is manifest in
society as in nature, that force, I mean,
<a name="png.091" id="png.091"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">79</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>which resists the separation of a body&#8217;s
particles. Different bodies possess different
powers of cohesion, <i>e.g.</i>, the cohesion
of chalk is far less than that of flint embedded
in it; even the same body possesses
different powers of cohesion in different
directions, <i>e.g.</i>, it is easier to split wood in
the direction of the fibres than perpendicular
to them. If by our old principle
of continuity we change the words &lsquo;bodies&rsquo;
into &lsquo;States&rsquo; or &lsquo;individuals,&rsquo; we shall see
that the same laws hold good in social
science as in natural philosophy.</p>

<p>These are a few analogous laws which I
have taken almost at random; but it must
strike the most casual listener to my
remarks that it is wondrous strange that
men, regarded as social beings, should
possess the same qualities, and be governed
by the same laws, as the rest of <em>matter</em>. As
Bishop Butler says, &lsquo;the force of analogy
consists in the frequency of the supposed
analogous facts, and the real resemblance
of the things compared.&rsquo; It appeals to
the reasoning faculty, and may form a solid
argument. Hence, if we can prove the
<a name="png.092" id="png.092"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">80</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>similarity of various laws and conditions, we
may not be wrong in assuming by analogy
the identity of those laws and conditions.</p>

<p>I have stated my case in this manner in
order to convince the gainsayers, if any
such there be, and to banish any doubts
or questionings which may have arisen
in your minds. I will now proceed with
some further investigations, full of the
most profound interest and importance.</p>

<p>Doubtless many of the lady-students
present are in the habit of welcoming
peaceful evening in with a potent draught
of &lsquo;the cup which cheers but not
inebriates;&rsquo; and as men are great
flatterers (for imitation is the greatest
flattery), I believe the male portion of my
audience have been known to follow that
excellent example. Some perhaps are in
the habit of burning the midnight oil, and
keep their eyes open by means of this
fruit of the hermit&#8217;s pious zeal, endowed
by high omnipotence with the power of
hindering sleep;<sup><a href="#fn.6" name="fna.6" id="fna.6">6</a></sup> but that practice I do
<a name="png.093" id="png.093"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">81</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>not advise, as that delicate portion of our
system, the nerves, especially of women,
often becomes injured by such stimulating
doses. However, you will have observed
(if you do not follow the modern pernicious
fashion of taking tea without sugar)
that numerous bubbles are formed upon
the surface of the liquid. After a few
moments these unite into one central
mass of bubbles by the force of mutual
attraction.</p>

<p>It appears from considerations which
are detailed in works on physical astronomy,
that two particles of matter placed at
any sensible distance apart attract each other
with a force directly proportional to the product
of their masses, and inversely proportional
to the square of their distance.</p>

<p>Now, suppose that we have a number
of circular masses situated upon a plane
<a name="png.094" id="png.094"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">82</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>surface, they will attract each other with a
force which may be determined with
exactitude; and the greater the masses
the greater the force. We will now apply
this to polemical science. The agricultural
settlement is the first stage in the
civilization and formation of a State.
How did this arise? First, a single family
immigrated to some uncultivated parts
of the country, perhaps accompanied by
others, who formed a little colony. Other
settlements were made in other parts of
the land; and thus the country became
overspread with these detached and separate
communities. An eminent writer
declares that these settlements can be
traced in the beginnings of every race
which has made progress; that they were
characteristic of those races in Greece and
Italy, in Asia and Africa, which grew into
the opulent and famous cities in which so
much in the early history of civilization
was developed. The colonies of England
have been formed in the same way, just
as in olden time England itself was occupied
when the Roman power ceased.</p>

<p><a name="png.095" id="png.095"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">83</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>These settlements correspond to the
circular masses situated on the plane
surface; they were quite separate from
each other, each having its own laws, its
own headman or ruler, its own assembly
or parish council. But as time elapsed,
the force of mutual attraction set in;
by degrees these separate settlements
were drawn together by force which increased
in proportion as the settlements
increased; until at last one united kingdom
was formed under one king, governed
by uniform laws and regulations. The
bubbles have blended, the circles have
come together, and one large circle or
other curve is the result. This may be
called the <em>Law of Social Attraction</em>. In
accordance with the results of one of my
previous lectures, I have taken the circle
as representing the simplest form of
government, which figure, in the case of
the elementary settlements, must have
been small.</p>

<p>Many of you, most noble professors,
are doubtless accustomed to make experiments
with the microscope. I will
<a name="png.096" id="png.096"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">84</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>suggest a simple one, which illustrates
very forcibly what I am endeavouring to
show you. Take some particles of copper,
and scatter them at intervals over the
surface of an object-glass, and pour some
sulphuric acid upon the glass. Now, what
is the result? A beautiful network of
apparently golden texture spreads itself
gradually over the whole area of the
glass. Steadily it pursues its way, and
the result is beautiful to behold. The
minute particles of copper were the original
settlements scattered over the land;
the sulphuric acid the civilizing agent;
and the final picture of a united civilized
homogeneous nation is well represented
by the progressive and finally glorious
network of gold. This example is of
course outside our present subject, but it
serves as a beautiful illustration.</p>

<p>As an instance of the attractive force
exercised by small communities upon each
other, I may mention the united kingdom
of Germany, which is composed of numerous
small States and nations, which have
been drawn together by the power of
<a name="png.097" id="png.097"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">85</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>mutual attraction. Until recently they
were each self-contained, separate constitutions,
with their own kings and forms of
government; but the attracting force,
assisted by forces from without, has
proved too much for them, and the great
and powerful united kingdom of Germany
is the result.</p>

<p>But why, you may ask, have not the
people in Hindustan united in the same
way? There the agricultural settlements
remain as they did ages ago; separate
petty chieftains rule under the all-governing
power of England. Why have they
not united?</p>

<p>To this objection I reply that there is
in social science, as in Nature, a <i>vis inertia</i>;
that is to say, there is a tendency in
matter to remain at rest if unmoved by
any external agency, and also of persisting
to move, after it has once been set in
motion. The <i>vis <ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'inetiar'">inertia</ins></i> of some bodies
is greater than that of others, and depends
upon their weight and density. Now it
so happens that the moral <i>vis inertia</i> of
the Hindustani is very great, hence their
<a name="png.098" id="png.098"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">86</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>tendency to amalgamation is small. They
remain in the state in which they happen
to be.</p>

<p>On the other hand the inertia of Englishmen
is small, of Englishwomen smaller,
and therefore their power of combining
is greater. Here let me observe that the
quality of inertia is one which ought to be
removed as far as possible from each
social system. Inertia was regarded as a
capital crime by the Egyptians. Solon
ordained that inert persons should be put
to death, and not contaminate the community.
As savages bury living men, so
does inertia practise the same barbarous
custom upon States and individuals.
Observe the putrid state of inert water,
the clear and sparkling beauty of the
moving stream, bearing away by the force
of its own motion aught that might contaminate
it. Men more often resemble
the stagnant water than the rivulet. A
healthy social state enforces labour by
natural laws, and banishes inertia as much
as possible from the system. If the
principles of some noisy English
<a name="png.099" id="png.099"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">87</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>politicians were fully carried out, and all
things made &lsquo;<em>free</em>,&rsquo; inertia would be increased,
and listless indolence pervade the
masses of our countrymen. I may say
that inertia is not entirely unknown in our
sister University of Cambridge.</p>

<p>The existence of social forces is supported
by the testimony of Dr. Tyndall,
who plainly recognises their power, though
he does not attempt to expound their
origin. &lsquo;Thoughtful minds are driven to
seek, in the interaction of social forces,
the genesis and development of man&#8217;s
moral nature. If they succeed in their
search&mdash;and I think they are sure to
succeed&mdash;social duty would be raised to
a higher level of significance, and the
deepening sense of social duty would, it
is to be hoped, lessen, if not obliterate,
the strife and heart-burnings which now
beset and disguise our social life.&rsquo; I
accept with gratification Dr. Tyndall&#8217;s
conclusions: to determine, examine, trace,
calculate these social forces which exercise
such a powerful influence on our characters,
our lives, our customs, which produce the
<a name="png.100" id="png.100"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">88</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>greatness of the State, or drag it down
with irresistible strength from its pinnacle
of glory to an abyss of degradation; to
estimate such forces is the great and noble
object of our lectures and researches in
this University. Prosecute, most noble
professors, your studies in this direction
with all the energy of your enlightened
intellects, and there is yet hope that this
new science, which I have endeavoured to
sketch out, however feebly, may be the
means of saving our beloved nation from
degradation and ruin, and raising her to
a higher level of glory and honour. I
hope to continue the subject of social
forces in my next lecture.</p>

<h3>ON SOCIAL FORCES (<i>continued</i>)&mdash;POLEMICAL
STATICS AND DYNAMICS.</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">Most Noble Professors and Students
of Girtham</span>,&mdash;We have embarked upon a
stormy sea of speculation, on a voyage of
grand discovery, and the dangerous waves
of adverse criticism, and the deceptive
under-current of prejudice, often make the
steersman&#8217;s lot by no means an enviable
one. But our vessel is sound and perfectly
equipped, and therefore I do not fear to
guide her across the great unknown.</p>

<p>It may have occurred to you that the
problems which present themselves for
solution in social science are far more
difficult and complicated than those which
arise in ordinary mathematics. That is
undoubtedly the case; but this extra
degree of difficulty is due to the fact that
<a name="png.102" id="png.102"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">90</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>we make no assumptions; we take the
things as they really are, not as they are
assumed to be. In physical science, if
we take into consideration the resistance
of the air, the curvature of the earth, the
rigid connection which exists between
particles in the same body, and a host of
other things which are often conveniently
neglected in elementary works, how complicated
the various problems become!
So we must not be surprised at some of
the difficulties which occur in social
science, as nothing is neglected; the whole
problem is before us, and having solved it
we need not make allowances for any
falsely assumed <i>data</i>.</p>

<p>It is possible that other professors of
this science may come to slightly different
conclusions to those which I have arrived
at. That is only to be expected, because
their original observations may have
slightly varied. But in physical science
allowances are made for different observers.
In astronomy, for example, we find the
value of the &lsquo;Personal Equation.&rsquo; One
observer on looking through the telescope
<a name="png.103" id="png.103"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">91</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>may take the meridian of a star rather
differently from another watcher of the
heavenly bodies, and the <em>personal equation</em>
is used to make allowances for this
quickness, or slowness, of observation.
So in social science there must be a
personal equation too, and our object
ought to be, in the ordinary affairs of life
as well as in the higher duties of scientific
action, to make our personal equation as
small as possible. But until the old
proverb, &lsquo;<i>Quot homines, tot sententiæ</i>,&rsquo; has
ceased to have any meaning, there will be
abundant need of this most useful aid to
accuracy.</p>

<p>The close connection which exists between
social forces and material forces is
plainly shown by the doctrine of the conservation
of energy. &lsquo;This doctrine,&rsquo; says
Dr. Tyndall, &lsquo;recognises in the material
universe a constant sum of power made
up of items among which the most Protean
fluctuations are incessantly going on. It
is as if the body of nature were alive, the
thrill and interchange of its energies resembling
those of an organism. The
<a name="png.104" id="png.104"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">92</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>parts of the stupendous whole shift and
change, augment and diminish, appear and
disappear; while the total of which they
are the parts remains quantitatively immutable,
<em>plus</em> accompanies <em>minus</em>, gain
accompanies loss, no item varying in the
slightest degree without an absolutely
equal change of some other item in the
opposite direction.&rsquo; So do the forces in
the social world ebb and flow, rise and
fall, carrying on the same universal law
which regulates the energy of material
force.</p>

<p>I will now proceed to enumerate some
of those forces which exercise such a
powerful influence on society.</p>

<p>First, let us take the force of <em>Public
Opinion</em>, which seems to exercise a relentless
sway over the minds and manners of
men. This is a very subtle and secret
force, which is most difficult to trace, and
resembles electricity in the science of
physics. We cannot see it, but are only
able to judge of its power by its results.
Its point of application is not in the individual,
but in the collection of individuals
<a name="png.105" id="png.105"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">93</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>who make up the social system; and it is,
in reality, the resultant of, or the compromise
between, the various elementary
forces which make up human society.
Yes, compromise is a purely mechanical
affair, based on the principle of the parallelogram
of forces; and as public opinion
is the result of a compromise, we may
calculate its force. For example: &lsquo;It is
required to know the state of public
opinion in the matter of politics, when
the results of a General Election show
that the Conservatives are to the Liberals
as <span class="nw">10 : 9</span>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Let OC be the direction of the Conservative
force.</p>

<p>Let OL be that of the Liberal.</p>

<p>Then by <i>data</i> <span class="nw">OC : OL :: 10 : 9</span>.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/illus-105.png" width="270" height="110"
  alt="Diagram: parallelogram with leading diagonal" title="" /></p>

<p>Complete the parallelogram, and join
OP.</p>

<p><a name="png.106" id="png.106"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">94</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Then OP represents the force of public
opinion in magnitude and direction.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;The direction of OL is determined
by the amount of deviation of the
policy of the Liberals from that of the
Conservatives.</p>

<p>As in physical, so in social science,
impulsive forces sometimes act, and effectually
disturb our system and our calculations.
Public opinion is very liable to
the action of disturbing forces. Panic is
an impulsive force, which defies the power
of the most learned professors of social
science to determine its magnitude and
direction. Some strange unforeseen catastrophe&mdash;the
fascination caused by a brilliant
and unscrupulous orator, a cruel wrong, a
blind revenge for real or imaginary injustice&mdash;will
sometimes rouse one element of
passion latent in the vast body of public
opinion; so that it breaks with all that
hitherto restrained and balanced it, and
precipitates society into a course of conduct
inconsistent with its former behaviour,
and bloodshed, revolution, the breaking-up
of laws, are the terrible results of panic
or revengeful passion.</p>

<p><a name="png.107" id="png.107"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">95</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Society is, as it were, split up by the
terrible action of such impulsive forces,
just as wood is split up by the repeated
blows of the hatchet. It is, therefore, the
duty of statesmen to increase the power
or force of cohesion, to strengthen the
fibres of the State, so that the force of
such impulsive blows may not be felt, nor
disturb the continuity of the framework
of the State. If such measures had been
adopted in the neighbouring country of
France, much misery might have been
avoided, and the terrible revolutions which
have so frequently convulsed her social
system entirely prevented.</p>

<p><em>Friction</em> is another disturbing element
in our calculations, and although it may
be made a useful servant, it is a bad
master in mathematics, as in polemics.
Without the aid of friction, progress would
be impossible. For example: Take the
case of a man with perfectly smooth skates
on perfectly hard, smooth ice; he would
be unable to reach the land unless he had
provided himself with some stones, by
throwing which he would just be able to
<a name="png.108" id="png.108"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">96</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>get to his destination by a backward
motion. The engine would be unable to
proceed on its iron road if it were not for
friction. The same is true in polemical
science: the government of the country
would not be able to be carried on under
our present conditions if it were not for <em>party
friction</em>. But suppose it increased indefinitely,
party friction becomes party <em>obstruction</em>;
and the engine of the State would no
longer proceed smoothly and evenly along
its appointed course at the rate of sixty
miles an hour, but would resemble an old-fashioned
coach, up to its axle-trees in
mud, its motion altogether stopped by the
action of party friction.</p>

<p>We have seen that forces have two ways
of acting: that of compelling rest and
that of producing motion. In statics
forces act so as to prevent any change
of motion, or disturb the body&#8217;s original
position. In kinetics, on the contrary,
the power is recognised as acting so as
to produce or change a body&#8217;s motion.
Now, in polemical science we have these
two ways of considering the action of
<a name="png.109" id="png.109"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">97</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>forces. There is the <em>statical</em> or <em>conservative</em>
force, which compels rest, which seeks
security, stability, and peace, and is not
ardently devoted to change. It reduces
the system to equilibrium. There are, of
course, two kinds of equilibrium&mdash;<em>stable</em>
and <em>unstable</em>&mdash;according as the social
and political system is in a healthy or
unhealthy state. If a body is in stable
equilibrium, and any slight motion takes
place, the body will return immediately to
its former position; but if in unstable, it
will decline further and further away from
its original position, and be entirely upset.
So a healthy and sound conservative equilibrium
is not disturbed by outside forces,
and the State will resume its former
position of stability and rest when the
opposing force is withdrawn. But an unhealthy
and insecure conservatism is as
easily disturbed as an egg balanced on its
narrow end.</p>

<p>The kinetics of society, that is to say
the Radical way of estimating force, is
the party of motion, generally supposed
to be the &lsquo;party of progress.&rsquo; It has
<a name="png.110" id="png.110"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">98</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>therefore many attractions in the eyes
of those who delight in motion, speed,
and rushing about. To run at full speed,
to feel the keen air upon one&#8217;s face, to
experience the delightful sensation of
freedom of will, and limb, are joys which
cannot be denied. Such exercise is beneficial
to the system, bodily or political.
Motion is the life of all things; it is
characteristic of nature; it adores nature;
because it is an emblem and characteristic
of life. The ceaseless rolling of the ocean
waves, the swaying of the trees, the bending
of the flowers, the waving of the corn,
all these fill us with pleasure; whereas a
flat uninteresting plain, unrelieved by the
motion of terrestrial objects, is depressing
to the spirit. So there is much to be said
in favour of motion, and Carlyle has
defined progress as &lsquo;living movement.&rsquo;
And men love this &lsquo;living movement,&rsquo; and
take up the Laureate&#8217;s cry:</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent6">&lsquo;Forward, forward, let us range,</div>
<div>Let the great world spin for ever down the ringing</div>
<div class="indent6">Grooves of change.&rsquo;</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But, after all, there is a danger in this
<a name="png.111" id="png.111"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">99</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>everlasting motion. We cannot tell
whither this progress may lead. It may
be along a safe sure road; but perchance
a precipice may open out before us; and
rejoicing in the acceleration of our
velocity, with eyes intent upon some
distant heights of glory and ambition, we
may not discover our danger until it is too
late to stop, and a terrible plunge into an
unknown abyss of turmoil and tumultuous
waves is the alarming result of an unguarded
policy of unrestrained &lsquo;progress.&rsquo; I recall
to my mind the quaint words of Holmes
which aptly illustrate my contention.</p>

<h3>LAWS OF POLITICAL MOTION.</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">Since</span> the last time I had the honour of
addressing you on polemical matters, I
have met with a passage in the writings of
M.&nbsp;Auguste Comte which afforded me
much pleasure. It seemed to be the one
word for which I had been waiting, and
confirmed many of my own impressions
and speculations. He lays down two
propositions: first, that the constructive
politics of the future must be based on the
history of the past; and second, that
political science is a composite study, and
presupposes the complete apprehension of
every branch of science, beginning with
the physical, such as astronomy, and
ending with the moral, such as ethics and
sociology. M. Comte evidently does not
regard as a vain dream and imaginative
<a name="png.114" id="png.114"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">102</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>speculation the theory that it will be
possible for statesmen to calculate a
policy, and to determine a course of
action by purely scientific considerations.
May I entertain the hope that in this
university, where all branches of physical
science have found a home, and are
studied by most able and learned professors,
the science of politics may be
pursued under most favourable circumstances?
I trust that each professor will
bring before me the results of their
deliberations, and contribute to the growth
of this particular science for which our
university has already become deservedly
famous.</p>

<p>My present lecture is devoted to the
important consideration of <em>Law</em>. At first
sight it may appear to you that the wills
and passions of mankind are so diverse
and unknowable, that it would be absurd
to suppose that they can be calculated, or
rendered amenable to any law. But Professor
Amos has pointed out that in proportion
as we examine history, and compare
the actions present and past of different
<a name="png.115" id="png.115"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">103</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>nations and states, the more uniform does
human nature appear; the more calculable
the actions, sentiments, and emotions of
large masses of people. As we have
already stated, the difficulties of the study
are not likely to deter the professors of
Girtham College from the pursuit of any
particular branch of science.</p>

<p><i>A priori</i> we might suppose from analogy
that these polemical laws existed, as there
is no department of nature which is not
governed by law. It is an essential feature
in nature, and also in government.
What is political economy but the study
of certain laws of nature? These were
first discovered by Adam Smith, and have
since been traced and estimated by such
men as Ricardo, the two Mills, Professor
Cairnes, Jevons, and many others. Moreover,
our physical constitutions are
governed by laws, which physicians have
determined, and which it is perilous to
resist. Our moral constitution is also
governed by laws, which evidently exist,
although it is difficult to find them out.
But the nation is only an assemblage of
<a name="png.116" id="png.116"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">104</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>individuals; and since individuals are
so governed, it is only natural to suppose
that the nation, composed of individuals,
is so constituted and controlled. And
not only is that true, but we shall see
that polemical laws are as permanent and
universal, as invariable and irreversible,
as the laws of nature which regulate the
courses of the heavenly bodies, and raise
the tides, or depress the sandstone hills.</p>

<p>We may notice first the preponderant
impulse observable in a nation&#8217;s life in
favour of supporting existing facts and
institutions; and every reformer has
discovered the difficulty and danger of
changing or opposing the customs and
habits of the people. As a wheel will
travel most smoothly along a well-worn
groove, whereby friction is diminished, so
there is a natural national tendency always
to run along those paths with which the
habits and customs of the people have
made them familiar. This law is nothing
else than Newton&#8217;s first law of motion,
which is quite as applicable to human
masses as to lifeless matter. The
<a name="png.117" id="png.117"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">105</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>tendency of matter to remain at rest, if unmoved
by any external agency, and of
persisting to move after it has once been
set in motion, is a conservative tendency;
and is as true in political science as in
any other.</p>

<p>The special branch of our science,
which we may call the <em>Biology of Politics</em>,
shows how absolute is the domain of law
in polemical matters. The law of human
life is that men are born, grow, become
strong and vigorous, and then decay and
die. This is the law of life, to which
we must all yield an enforced obedience.
This same law is observed to be at work
in the heavenly bodies; and astronomy
shows us that planets are born, flourish,
and at length die, just as our human
bodies do. The moon is, as you may
have observed, a dead planet, such as our
earth may be some day. The same
growth and decay are also manifest in
national life. First, there is the birth of
the nation, which sometimes lies a long
time in a dormant state, and then wakes
up to life and energy. China and Russia
<a name="png.118" id="png.118"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">106</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>are examples of dormant States, just
waking from a long sleep of childishness
and ignorance. The next stage is the
strong an healthy period of its existence,
which England is at present enjoying;
and then, after various stages of gradual
decline, we come to the senile period of
national life, when every energy and
faculty, every national feeling and power
of invention, are completely exhausted.
As an example of this depressing condition,
we may mention Turkey and several
of the effete States of South America.
Sometimes, when life is nearly extinct in
the human body, physicians have made
use of the power of galvanism, in order to
revive the dying energies. This process
of galvanizing a State into life was tried
by Lord Palmerston and others on the
worn-out frame of Turkey. But such
attempts can only meet with partial and
transitory success; and where the loss of
national power and faculty betokens the
senile period of the nation&#8217;s existence, it
is vain to attempt to restore its former
life and energy. The study of the biology
<a name="png.119" id="png.119"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">107</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of politics presents many interesting and
important details in this special branch
of knowledge; and I commend this part
of our subject to the special attention of
the professor of physiology. The law of
development is observable in nations as
in nature. Recent scientific discoveries
have tended to take away all ideas of
<em>chance</em> in the workings of nature, and have
substituted <em>law</em> instead of it. It would
be unscientific and incorrect to speak of
the world being formed by the &lsquo;fortuitous
concourse of atoms.&rsquo; So we cannot speak
of a State being generated in this manner.
Laws&mdash;economical, geographical, natural&mdash;preside
over the formation of States and
nations, and produce their further development.</p>

<p>The laws of political motion occupy
the same prominent place in our new
science as Newton&#8217;s laws do in ordinary
dynamics. These are very important in
calculating the positions which various
States will occupy in the future. First,
we have the <em>doctrine of nationality</em>, which
prevented the progress of Austria into
<a name="png.120" id="png.120"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">108</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Italy, and of the Bourbons in Naples, and
produced the amalgamation of the small
German States in the great empire of
Germany. The second law of political
motion is the doctrine of the <em>independence</em>
of all true States, and the equality
of all States to each other. This had its
growth in feudalism; and all the chief
wars of modern times have been the result
of the efforts of nature to establish this
law of independence. The doctrine of
intervention is a modification of the preceding
law, and is applicable when the
law of necessity demands its use, such as
the restoration of order after protracted
anarchy, the abolition of slave trade, etc.
The third law is the <em>law of morality</em>.
Just as for each man there exists a <em>right</em>
and a <em>wrong</em>; just as <em>duty</em> and <em>conscience</em>
are certain elements in his daily motion,
which dictate his course of action,
although he may chose to neglect them;
so a nation is bound by the same moral
laws which govern the individual; and
a nation errs if it transgresses them.
Christianity is the agent which has
<a name="png.121" id="png.121"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">109</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>produced so powerful an influence in making
men obey the dictates of conscience and
walk in the path of duty; and I read
with thankfulness the conclusion of Mr.
Amos, that Christianity has triumphed
quite as much in moralizing secular
politics as it has in the sphere of individual
life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These are some of the principal laws of
motion which I have observed at work in
various States and nations. Inasmuch as
political science embraces, in addition to
the physical sciences, all those branches
which are contained in ethics, economics,
jurisprudence, sociology and others, the
laws of each are generally applicable to the
whole grand subject of which my lectures
treat. Other general laws may be deduced,
and have been enumerated in my previous
lectures, from the social properties of curves
and conics; and when our researches are
complete we may hope to produce a code
of laws for the guidance of our statesmen
which maybe of immense use in determining
<a name="png.122" id="png.122"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">110</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the policies of the future. Already
there is strong evidence that the affairs of
this country are being conducted on sound
scientific principles, rather than by any
species of guess-work or haphazard contrivances.
The use of history is recognised
as extremely important in determining
a future line of conduct; and statesmen
are in the habit of endeavouring to find
from their study of the past what is the
logical sequence of events. Just as mathematicians
endeavour to determine the law
of a series of figures, and having found the
law, can write down the next, and the next,
<i>ad infinitum</i>; so scientific politicians may
be able soon to establish the various laws
of a series of events, and calculate their
course of actions. That there is considerable
progress in this direction is manifest
by the value which they place upon statistics,
and their continued use of this important
information.</p>

<p>There are a few great evils in our present
system which are strongly opposed to any
scientific methods in politics; and in the
interests of the country as well as those of
<a name="png.123" id="png.123"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">111</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>science they ought to be removed. One
great evil is the want of political and
scientific knowledge on the part of the
electors, who are in the habit of choosing
their representatives on personal grounds,
or party considerations, rather than on
sound principles of political science. All
this is opposed to any idea of law. Owing
to the ignorance of the electors they fall an
easy prey to adventurers and unprincipled
politicians, who make all kinds of specious
promises, tempt them with all manner of
baits, and make self-interest instead of the
welfare of the State the principle of voting.
Selfishness is the ruin of social life and intercourse,
the destroyer of all happiness,
peace, and mutual trust in family life or in
society. It is the root of most of the faults,
vices, and crimes in the individual; and
who can tell the endless disasters which
will befall the State, where selfishness is the
chief motive-power of the electors and the
elected? A selfish statesman, one who goes
into Parliament to gain his own ends and
forward his own personal interests, is a disgrace
to society&mdash;</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div><a name="png.124" id="png.124"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">112</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Feeling himself, his own low self, the whole,</div>
<div>When he by sacred sympathy might make</div>
<div>The whole one self. Self, that no alien knows!</div>
<div>Self, far diffused as fancy&#8217;s wing can travel!</div>
<div>Self, spreading still, oblivious of its own,</div>
<div>Yet all of all possessing!&rsquo;</div>
</div>

<p>I have said that the ignorance of the
electorate makes them an easy prey to such
men; and until they have learnt to detect
the false from the true, until they become
acquainted with the elements of political
science, and have been taught that their
own selfish interests are not the highest
aims of social government, it is vain to
hope for a reasonable method of regulating
the affairs of the nation, based upon
logical laws and scientific principles.</p>

<p>And how is this work of educating the
electors to be accomplished? Not, I
maintain, by furious speeches and rhetorical
displays; not by bribery, baits and
banter; but by patient, never-ceasing
labour, by lectures on history and science,
by individual instruction, is the great work
to be accomplished upon which the security
and stability of the country depend.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">Then we may hope that the &lsquo;Reign of
<a name="png.125" id="png.125"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">113</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Law&rsquo; in polemical science may be ushered
in with the joyful acclamations of an enlightened
and united people, and its benign
influence extend from the throne of the
monarch and the council-chamber of his
ministers to the hearth of the cottager.
Politicians will rule by law; policies be calculated
by laws; people vote by law; and
then methinks I see in my mind (to use
the words of the blind old poet) a noble
and puissant nation rousing herself like a
strong man after sleep, and shaking her invincible
locks; methinks I see her as an
eagle, renewing her mighty youth, and kindling
her undazzled eyes at the full mid-day
beam; purging and unsealing her long-abused
sight at the fountain itself of
heavenly radiance; while the whole noise
of timorous and flocking birds flutter about
amazed at what she means. Such is the
glorious vision of the &lsquo;Reign of Law.&rsquo; Let
it be the business of every Englishman and
Englishwoman to arrange the framework of
our social and political system, that law
may have an uninterrupted sway; then
shall we be a united, prosperous, and
<a name="png.126" id="png.126"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">114</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>contented people, and the reign of lawless
agitators, bribery-mongers, and counterfeit
statesmen will have passed away into the
oblivion and obscurity of a more suitable
but less favoured region.</p>

<h3>ON THE PRINCIPLE OF POLEMICAL COHESION.</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">In</span> my previous lectures I have had occasion
to mention the principle of cohesion;
but it plays so vital a part in the constitution
of States and their relations to each
other that I consider it advisable to devote
this lecture entirely to it.</p>

<p>This is a large and comprehensive
subject, and embraces such principles as
the Centralization of States; the Co-operation
of States; Monogamic Marriage;
Unions; Free Trade, and many
others equally important. We have
already noticed that cohesion is a well-known
property of matter; that its
influence is not confined to the regions of
physical sciences; and that it is the
<a name="png.128" id="png.128"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">116</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>manifest duty of all governments to increase
the force of cohesion.</p>

<p>Various methods have been tried to
accomplish this purpose. The principle
of Feudalism was one of the earliest
attempts to produce the cohesion of the
nation; and, in an elementary condition of
society, it was partly successful. The
theories of &lsquo;Divine Right&rsquo; and &lsquo;Social
Contract&rsquo; were other methods which have
been adopted; and the unity of the
Christian Church has been the great
means of producing the cohesion of the
State in olden times; and its aid may be
again required for the same beneficent
object in future complications and social
disruptions.</p>

<p>But it is always advantageous in scientific
pursuits to go back to first principles; and
we will adopt that method in our present
investigations. The social unit is the
family; the multiplication of families
makes the tribe; the multiplication of
tribes makes the State; and, therefore, we
shall not be far wrong if we consider the
family tie as the first principle of political
<a name="png.129" id="png.129"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">117</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>cohesion. I am in agreement with several
learned thinkers upon this subject when
I say that marriage is a most important
political factor; and as marriage cannot
take place without women, it is evident
that women play a very important part in
promoting the cohesion of the State.</p>

<p>This prominent position was duly
assigned to women by one of our greatest
political philosophers, M.&nbsp;Auguste Comte,
who strongly opposed the fatal fallacy of
ancient political systems, which greatly
overestimated the powers of men, and
depreciated those of women. If the
superiority of bodily strength be the sole
cause of greatness in political and intellectual
pursuits, then, most noble lords of
creation, we yield to you the palm&mdash;you
are our masters in this respect. But if, on
the other hand, it can be shown that
physical strength is not a requisite for
great achievements in these occupations;
if the powers of endurance, elasticity,
adaptability, nervous energy, and patience
are quite as needful as mere animal
strength; then we women are quite as
<a name="png.130" id="png.130"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">118</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>capable, and indeed more capable than
men, for achieving political greatness. In
the &lsquo;good old days,&rsquo; when the law of
might was right, and the strongest arm was
the most powerful machinery in the
government of the country, women were
compelled naturally to occupy a less prominent
position in the conduct of the
affairs of the nation; and for centuries
they have been degraded by a dominating
tradition, and supposed incapable of
performing duties for which they were
mentally well suited. But those militant
days are past. Animal strength and
brute force are no longer needed in the
councils of the nation; and the time has
arrived when women should cease to be
oppressed by the disparaging, illogical
deductions of former generations, and
when their assistance ought to be invoked
in the great work of promoting the
nation&#8217;s welfare.</p>

<p>I have stated that marriage is an important
political factor; and, therefore,
women have always occupied a primary,
though obscure, part in political affairs.
<a name="png.131" id="png.131"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">119</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>The cohesion of the State has been
produced by the secret influence of
family life. But it may be asked, What
kind of marriage is most conducive to
national cohesion? This question has
been carefully and conclusively answered
by a learned scientific writer, who shows
that polygamic marriage never exists in an
advanced state, as instanced by the
history of Judaism and Mohammedanism;
that a strict form of monogamic marriage
is essential to political greatness and true
progress in civilization. The cohesion of
the State is destroyed by polygamy, and
by any system which relaxes the binding
nature of the marriage tie. &lsquo;Domestic
disorganization is a sure augury of political
disruption.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Cohesion, the essential property of all
rightly constituted nations, is often in
danger of being lost when the State is
geographically very large, or when local
interests have greater power than the
attractive force of the central government.
To obviate this evil, the method of centralization
has been adopted with satisfactory
<a name="png.132" id="png.132"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">120</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>results, as in the case of the United States
of America, and Germany.</p>

<p>By this means the local authorities are
brought into close relationship with the
central head, and the centrifugal influences
of independent interests and customs
are counteracted by the force of
central attraction. Centralization increases
the importance of the whole body, and,
like the pendulum of a clock, regulates the
movements of the whole State. In some
cases it tends to make the government
despotic, when the local governments are
entirely under the control of the central;
and every enactment, and scheme, and
plan checked and supervised by the chief
officers of the State. Such was the system
adopted in France by Napoleon&nbsp;III.
But cohesion without the enforcement of
a hard and rigid connection, a general
supervision without severe tyrannical jurisdiction,
are the best methods of securing
the unity of composite States.</p>

<p>But the force of cohesion is evidently
at work in the nation apart from centralization.
Men who have a community of
<a name="png.133" id="png.133"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">121</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>interests unite together for the purposes of
strength and mutual assistance. They
combine for the sake of securing means
of support in sickness, and form benefit
societies, such as the Order of Oddfellows
or Foresters. This force of cohesion has
produced trade unions, and similar institutions
which exist for the purpose of
protecting a common interest, and giving
expression to the concurrent opinions of
the members. These have their legitimate
use in every civilized State, in spite of
some of the disadvantages which follow in
their train. There are, of course, opposed
interests in every community: <em>attractive</em>
forces, which produce trade unions,
guilds, corporations, companies, and the
like; and <em>repulsive</em> forces, which result
from the opposed interests of employers
and employed, landlords and tenants, and
similar pairs of different classes in the
community. As time goes on, and the
State advances with it, these forces will
gain in strength; the cohesion of classes
will become greater; association will grow
as naturally as the bubbles form on the
<a name="png.134" id="png.134"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">122</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>surface of our evening beverage. It is a
law of nature, and therefore cannot be
resisted. But the repulsive forces will be
no less strong, and to calculate the
resultant of these contending interests will
be the problem for practical statesmen to
solve.</p>

<p>The force of cohesion is also evidently
at work, not only in individual States, but
also amongst the nations of Europe, and
of the world. That is to say, there is an
evident desire for co-operation on the part
of those nations who have attained to the
highest degree of civilization and internal
cohesion. International law is based on
the principle of cohesion, and every day it
is gaining power and favour in the eyes of
our leading statesmen. The doctrine of
Free Trade, which, if universally adopted,
would be of the greatest service to mankind,
results from a desire for co-operation;
and whatever evils may result from one-sided
Free Trade in this country at the
present time, there can be no doubt that
ultimately the complete system will be
adopted.</p>

<p><a name="png.135" id="png.135"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">123</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Sad is the fate of a nation when the
force of cohesion is weakened. The first
revolution in France is a proof of this
assertion; there was no cohesion, no common
faith, or loyalty to the throne and
Government; and indeed the Government,
which was rotten to the core, was
hardly likely to awake any feelings of
loyalty and respect; and therefore the
social disruption which followed was only
a natural sequence of events, and was
prophesied with the accuracy with which
an astronomer can foretell an eclipse.
But that is not all; when the cohesion of
the State is destroyed, it takes a long time
to restore the action of the force; and, as
in the case of France, further disruption is
sure to take place.</p>

<p>In this lecture I have already enumerated
some of the ways in which this force
acts; there are doubtless others which
will suggest themselves to you. But I
contend that the prosperity of the State,
and the peace of the world, depend upon
cohesion. Let this be your work, most
noble professors, to promote the action of
<a name="png.136" id="png.136"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">124</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>this helpful and life-giving force. Promote,
as far as in you lies, the sacred
union of family life. Encourage the
generous feelings of true loyalty and
patriotism amongst the people of this
realm of England; counsel our statesmen
with regard to the primary necessity of
national cohesion, and the advantages of

<p class="above2">[<span class="smc">Editorial Note.</span>]&mdash;We regret to state
that the various MSS. in the sealed desk
are nearly exhausted, and are therefore
compelled to present the series of lectures
on polemical studies in an incomplete
form. But we had the good fortune to
light upon a brief diary which discloses
some interesting information with regard
to the Author&#8217;s life and occupations. We
append a few extracts:</p>

<p><i>June 3rd</i>.&mdash;Arnold called again to-day&mdash;the
fifth time during the last fortnight!
His attention is rather overpowering, and
wastes much of my valuable time. He
says he hates science&mdash;the heathen!&mdash;and
wants me to lecture in classics. He affirms
that mathematics are dry and hard&mdash;too
hard for women, and tend to make them
unsympathetic and critically severe. I am
afraid I was rather severe with him. But
really he is very trying, and always seems
to talk like a Greek chorus in the most
profound platitudes. Arnold is a classical
tutor at Clare College. My old pupil
is getting on famously. Poor fellow! he
seems quite oppressed with his work. But
he is making great progress, and sticks
to his books like&mdash;a student of Girtham
College!</p>

<p><i>June 4th</i>.&mdash;Lectured on the Scientific
Basis of Blackstone&#8217;s Commentaries; afterwards
received pupils until 1 p.m. Really
Blanch <span class="nw">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> is more tiresome than ever.
<a name="png.138" id="png.138"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span

 </span>It appears that she has taken up with a
young undergraduate of King&#8217;s, and there
is no prospect of any improvement in her
work unless this nonsense is terminated.
How foolish some of my sex are, in spite of
their improved opportunities! I blush for
them! Arnold has sent me a copy of Robert
Browning&#8217;s &lsquo;Belaustion,&rsquo; in order to make
me like classics, and give up science.
Misguided young man! He has written
some tolerable verses on the fly-leaf; but
I have no intention of playing Belaustion
to his &lsquo;entranced youth.&rsquo; These are his
verses:</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div>&lsquo;My lady dear, if I may call you so,</div>
<div>For you are dearer than all else beside,</div>
<div>I know the love you bear to golden verse,</div>
<div>To golden thoughts enshrined in classic lore,</div>
<div>To all that&#8217;s beautiful; so here I send</div>
<div>Some echoes of the songs of ancient days,</div>
<div>Attuned and chanted by an English bard,</div>
<div>Who fires one&#8217;s old love for the rolling lines</div>
<div>Of youthful Hellas; may your cultured ear</div>
<div>Receive, and gladly welcome his sweet song.</div>
<div>And while we revel in the poet&#8217;s dream,</div>
<div>And hear his actors speak, we&#8217;ll play our parts.</div>
<div>You, sweet Belaustion on the temple-steps,</div>
<div>Taking your captors captive by your voice;</div>
<div>And I, the youth who, more entranced than all,</div>
<div>Was bound by fetters that he would not loose;</div>
<div>And so we&#8217;ll play our part. What say you, dear?&rsquo;</div>
</div>

 /></span><i>June 6th</i>.&mdash;Have just seen our new
Professor of Physics, Amelia Cordial, who
is an excellent woman, and well suited for
the high office which she holds. She has
told me of the foolish conduct of Lady
Mary, who is evidently of opinion that
the professorial mantle ought to have
fallen on her shoulders. Really, this
jealousy in the ranks of the learned is
most disgraceful; and the bickerings which
arise from disappointed ambition, the envyings
and silly quarrels, are the weak places
in our female collegiate system.</p>

<p>Such good news! The wrangler list is
just out, and my hard-working pupil is
<em>bracketed twelfth!</em> This is really delightful,
and abundantly repays us for all our
hard toil. But really I have not found
working with him distasteful; he is such
an excellent pupil, so painstaking and
eager, that I have quite looked forward to
his coming, and found him much more
interesting than some of these foolish
maidens. But I almost dread seeing him.
He will be so elated and overpoweringly
grateful, whereas I ought to be grateful to
<a name="png.140" id="png.140"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">128</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>him for all his work for me; for I am sure
he would never have gone in for the Tripos
if I had not persuaded him. Well, I
wonder why he does not come to tell me
of his triumph.</p>

<p><i>June 7th</i>.&mdash;<em>It</em> has come! and I half
expected it. My eager pupil writes with
all the energy and love of his noble nature
to ask me to be his wife! He says <em>that</em>
is all he cares for, and only values his
Honours as a step to a higher honour and
dignity, that of gaining my love and being
my husband. All this is very nice to read;
but a terribly difficult problem is placed
before me for solution. I do indeed love
this dear, good fellow&mdash;no one could help
doing so, I am sure; but do I not love
science more? There is a stringent regulation
in this University that no one shall
occupy the position of professor who is
bound by any domestic ties or cares. All
married women are excluded. If I say
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I must resign my high position,
leave this beloved college, give no more
lectures to entranced audiences. In the
interests of science, ought I to refuse, and
<a name="png.141" id="png.141"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">129</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>sacrifice my heart&#8217;s affections for the cause
of mathematics? But if I say &lsquo;No,&rsquo; I
must give up&mdash;<em>him</em>; sacrifice his happiness
too, and blight his life. Was ever
anyone so perplexed? Science, aid thine
obedient servant! May I not determine
this vital question by thine all-pervading
light?&hellip;</p>

<p class="tbstars">* * * * *</p>

<p>[<span class="smc">Editorial Note.</span>]&mdash;We had just arrived
at this exciting moment in the life
of the learned and accomplished lady
whose writings form the subject of these
pages&mdash;a moment when love and science
were trembling in the balance&mdash;when a
footstep was heard upon the stairs leading
to our study, and ere we could secrete our
MS. the door was opened, and a well-known
voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not know why you should have
become so studious lately, Ernest, and
why you should refuse to take me into
your confidence. You spend hours and
hours in this room all by yourself, writing
away, and never say a word to me about
the subject of your literary work. There
<a name="png.142" id="png.142"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">130</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>was a time when things were different, and
you were not so slow in availing yourself
of my help, and asking my advice.&rsquo;</p>

<p>We murmured something about taking
up the pen which had been laid aside by
a far abler hand, and our deep gratitude
for past assistance in our work, which could
never be forgotten.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And do you think that I cannot help
you now?&rsquo; our visitor replied, in a very
injured tone of voice. &lsquo;Is the old power
dead, because it has not recently been
used? Ernest, I think you very ungrateful
not to confide in me. Come, tell me
what you are writing.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A suggestion about the proverbial
curiosity of women rose to our lips, but
died away without utterance. In the
meantime, her eyes wandered over our
study-table strewed with papers, and lighted
upon the well-worn desk.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, Ernest, where did you find this?
My dear old desk, which has been lost
ever so long! I do believe you have been
ransacking its contents! Why did you
<a name="png.143" id="png.143"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">131</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>not tell me that you had found it? What
are you doing with my papers, sir?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The mischief was out! We tried to
explain that the world ought not to be
deprived of that which would benefit mankind;
that the peace and prosperity of
the country might be sacrificed if it were
deprived of these discoveries of science,
which were calculated to secure such beneficial
results.</p>

<p>At length we gained our point, and obtained
the full sanction of the late Lady
Professor of Girtham College to publish
her papers. Thus her obedient pupil is
enabled to repay his late instructress for
all her kindness to him, and in some
measure to compensate the scientific and
political world for the loss of one of its
most original investigators in the regions
of polemical studies, which, not without a
struggle, she resigned when she deigned
to become his wife.</p>
